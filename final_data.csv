11,jaime, there was nothing to be afraid of until you told father [in a whisper mimicking] we’re lannisters lannisters don’t act like fools  but who would he tell  if he told the king both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now whatever jon arryn knew or didn’t know it died with him and robert will choose a new hand of the king someone to do his job while he’s off fucking boars and hunting whores or is it the other way around and life will go on  that’s an honor i can do without their days are too long their lives are too short  don’t get up  you’ve much to teach me no doubt but our sister craves your attention  a family trait now the starks are feasting us at sundown don’t leave me alone with these people  i thought you might say that but since we’re short on time  come on girls see you at sundown  i hear we might be neighbors soon i hope it’s true  i’m sure we’ll have a tournament to celebrate the new title if you accept it would be good to have you in the field the competition has become a bit stale  no getting a little old for it  well said  are you completely mad  it’s all right it’s all right  i heard you the first time  quite the little climber aren’t you how old are you boy  ten  the things i do for love,1,1,245

22,sandor clegane, the prince will remember that little lord  do i frighten you so much girl or is it him there making you shake he frightens me too look at that face  he hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years since the mad king had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers  he ran not very fast,2,1,56

26,soldier 2, it's a direwolf  i think i heard a noise,2,1,9
27,theon, saw what my lady  if it comes to that you know i'll stand behind you,2,1,15
28,tyrion, before you go you will call on lord and lady stark and offer your sympathies  none but it is expected of you your absence has already been noted  one word and i'll hit you again  go tell her but first you will get to lord and lady stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are that you are at their service and that all your prayers are with them do you understand  do you understand  i hope so if he forgets be a good dog and remind him time for breakfast  bread and two of those little fish and a mug of dark beer to wash it down and bacon burnt black  beloved siblings  apparently not  the maester says the boy may live  only the gods know for certain all the rest of us can do is pray the charms of the north seem entirely lost on you  where's your sense of wonder the greatest structure ever built the intrepid men of the night's watch the wintry abode of the white walkers  and go celibate the whores would go begging from dorne to casterly rock i just want to stand on top of the wall and piss off the edge of the world  speaking for the grotesques i'd have to disagree death is so final whereas life life is full of possibilities i hope the boy does wake i'd be very interested to hear what he has to say  my dear brother you wound me you know how much i love my family  rapers they were given a choice no doubt castration or the wall most choose the knife not impressed by your new brothers lovely thing about the watch you discard your old family and get a whole new one  look at me and tell me what you see   what you see is a dwarf if i'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die alas i was born a lannister of casterly rock things are expected of me my father was the hand of the king for 20 years  yes until my brother killed him life is full of these little ironies my sister married the new king and my repulsive nephew will be king after him i must do my part for the honor of my house wouldn't you agree but how well my brother has his sword and i have my mind and a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone that's why i read so much and you what's your story bastard   a bastard boy with nothing to inherit off to join the ancient order of the night's watch alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms  yes yes against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about you're a smart boy you don't believe that nonsense everything's better with some wine in the belly,2,1,492
29,viys, i have no interest in hospitality or comfort i'll stay with drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and i have my crown  well mormont as brutish as this life is i suppose it is preferable to beheading what did ned stark want you for buying from a slaver  under my reign you won't be punished for such nonsense you can rest assured of that,2,1,67
0,aemon, how many winters have you seen lord tyrion  all of them brief  the night's watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond and it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men there are less than a thousand of us now we can't man the other castles on the wall we can't properly patrol the wilderness we've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed  when winter does come gods help us all if we're not ready,3,1,87
1,alli the, if that were a real sword you'd be dead lord snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you pyp do you think ned stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us  next  next  lord snow it appears you're the least useless person here go clean yourselves up there's only so much i can stomach in a day,3,1,63
2,arya,  i'm practicing  the prince  he's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend  the hound does whatever the prince tells him to do  you're a liar and if you told the truth mycah would be alive  go away   mine  i wasn't playing and i don't want to be a lady   it's called needle  stick 'em with the pointy end  i was trying to learn i asked mycah to practice with me i asked him it was my fault  i hate them i hate all of them the hound the queen and the king and joffrey and sansa  so was i he is a liar  but how you can let her marry someone like that  winter is coming  i don't hate her not really  i can keep it   who are you   it's too heavy  what if i drop it  i'm a girl   a needle,3,1,145
3,barristan selmy, of course your grace  a tyroshi never learned the name  lance through the heart  i was there that day you were only a squire 16 years old  a good fighter toyne but he lacked stamina,3,1,35
4,benjen,"  i wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time i'm leaving this morning  i'm the first ranger my job is out there there have been disturbing reports   the kind i don't want to believe  you're not going you're no ranger jon  better than no one here a man gets what he earns when he earns it we'll speak when i return  the night's watch is a joke to you is it is that what we are lannister an army of jesters in black   i hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in king's landing but something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there enjoying your brothels half the boys you've seen training will die north of the wall might be a wilding's axe that gets them might be sickness might just be the cold they die in pain and they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort  call me what you like  you know my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word ""but"" really counts   you're right the wildlings are no different from us a little rougher maybe but they're made of meat and bone i know how to track them and i know how to kill them it's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights you've never been north of the wall so don't tell me what's out there   enjoy the capital brother",3,1,251
5,bran,  i hate your stories  those weren't my favorites my favorites were the scary ones   maybe we do   i did though it's true isn't it what maester luwin says about my legs i'd rather be dead  i'd rather be dead,3,1,39
6,catelyn,  it's nine years since i've set foot in the capital and no one knew who i was the last time i came either   i would we've done nothing wrong  instructed i don't know who's providing your instructions but   you little worm you take me for some back-alley sally you can drag into a…   how dare you bring me here have you lost your mind   how did you know i was coming to king's landing   lord varys  how did you know i was coming   do you know whose dagger this is   yours  to whom   ned [poking her head out of a window]  we have proof we have the blade   petyr has promised to help us find the truth he's like a little brother to me he would never betray my trust  i won't forget this you're a true friend   i wish i could see the girls  just for a moment  i know they did it ned the lannisters in my bones i know it  my temper gods be good you nearly killed poor littlefinger yesterday  does he,3,1,176
7,cersei, please it's nearly healed  a king should have scars you fought off a direwolf you're a warrior like your father  that's not true you killed the beast you only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father when aerys targaryen sat on the iron throne your father was a rebel and a traitor someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it  yes she's very beautiful and young if you don't like her you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes to make little princes and princesses and if you'd rather fuck painted whores you'll fuck painted whores and if you'd rather lie with noble virgins so be it you are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be do something nice for the stark girl  no but you will the occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road  how would you handle them   a royal army  and if the northerners rebel  and these 10000 northern troops would they fight for you or their lord   but you've just invaded their homeland asked them to kill their brothers  the north cannot be held not by an outsider it's too big and too wild when the winter comes the seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army a good king knows when to save his strength and when to destroy his enemies   everyone who isn't us is an enemy  how could you be so stupid  he's a child 10 years old what were you thinking  nothing he's said nothing he remembers nothing  what if it comes back to him if he tells his father what he saw  and my husband  let me go  let me go  and if you find the proof,3,1,309
8,daenerys,  do the dothrakis buy their slaves  from whom  tell them all to stop   until i command them otherwise  not a queen a khaleesi   no   please please don't hurt him tell him i don't want my brother harmed   what are you doing   it’s a boy  i know,3,1,46
9,grenn, you broke my nose bastard  if we threw you over the wall wonder how long it'd take you to hit  what're you looking at halfman  we'll talk later lord snow,3,1,30
10,guard, welcome to king's landing lady stark would you mind following us  we've been instructed to escort you into the city  follow me lady stark,3,1,24
11,irri, rakharo ask if you want him dead khaleesi  rakharo say you should take ear to teach respect  yes khaleesi  when was last time you bleed khaleesi you change khaleesi it’s a blessing from the great stallion  the khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight kill some rabbits  find some ducks she likes ducks  dog then i have seen many dogs  the khaleesi have baby inside her it is true she does not bleed for two moons her belly start to swell  she does not want to eat horse,3,1,88
12,jaime," thank the gods you're here stark about time we had some stern northern leadership  sturdy old thing how many kings' asses have polished it i wonder what's the line the king shits and the hand wipes  i know people have been swinging at me for years but they always seem to miss  i have a knack for it it must be strange for you coming into this room i was standing right here when it happened he was very brave your brother your father too they didn't deserve to die like that nobody deserves to die like that  500 men just stood there and watched all the great knights of the seven kingdoms you think anyone said a word lifted a finger no lord stark 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt except for the screams of course and the mad king laughing and later when i watched the mad king die i remembered him laughing as your father burned it felt like justice  tell me if i'd stabbed the mad king in the belly instead of the back would you admire me more  calm down  i was thinking of us you're a bit late to start complaining about it now what has the boy told them  then what are you raving about  we'll say he was lying we'll say he was dreaming we'll say whatever we like i think we can outfox a 10-year-old  never  the boy won't talk and if he does i'll kill him him ned stark the king the whole bloody lot of them until you and i are the only people left in this world  one of the outlaws in the brotherhood  you killed simon toyne with a counter riposte best move i ever saw  i cut his head off so no  he said the same thing he'd been saying for hours ""burn them all"" if that's all your grace",3,1,318
13,jeor, i don't need him to be charming i need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the night's watch  slowly a raven came for ned stark's son  both  we've been capturing wildlings more every month they're fleeing south the ones who flee say they've seen the white walkers  one of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions he swore it right up to the moment ned stark chopped his head off  your sister sits by the side of the king tell her we need help,3,1,93
14,jof,  it's ugly   i'm not like him i didn't fight off anything it bit me and all i did was scream and the two stark girls saw it both of them  do i have to marry her   i don't want to  we allow the northerners too much power they consider themselves our equals   i'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10000 men to the royal army   why should every lord command his own men it's primitive no better than the hill tribes we should have a standing army of men loyal to the crown trained by experienced soldiers instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives  i'd crush them seize winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as warden of the north uncle kevan maybe   for me i'm their king   i'm not asking   so you agree the starks are enemies,3,1,147
15,jon,  it's an improvement  everybody knew what this place was and no one told me no one but you my father knew and left me to rot here at the wall all the same  they hate me because i'm better than they are  you're leaving   what kind of reports  'm ready i won't let you down  but i'm better than every  don't stand so still it's harder to hit a moving target except for you you move too much i could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me   i'm sorry to see you leave lannister   will you stop at winterfell on your way south   if you see my brother bran tell him i miss him tell him i'd visit if i could  he'll never walk again  farewell my lord,3,1,134
16,jorah,  the dothraki don't believe in money most of their slaves were given to them as gifts  you want the entire horde to stop for how long   you're learning to talk like a queen   shall we return to the khalasar khaleesi   for a man on horseback the curved blade is a good thing easier to handle it's a good weapon for a dothrakan but a man in full plate the arakh won't get through the steel that's where the broadsword has the advantage designed for piercing plate  armor   slow  it's true but it also keeps a man alive   i’ve heard that your father was a famous warrior  he still is a man of great honor and i betrayed him  i don't think she wants to eat dog  i'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper i need to ride to qohor  don't worry i'll catch you the horde's easy to find,3,1,151
17,jory, yes my lord,3,1,3
18,khal drogo, how do you know,3,1,4
19,lancel, it's empty your grace  there's no more wine,3,1,8
20,little finger, but we have a kingdom to look after i've hoped to meet you for some time lord stark no doubt lady catelyn has mentioned me  all too well i still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone  it wasn't the man that i chose my lord it was catelyn tully a woman worth fighting for i'm sure you'll agree   we are the lords of small matters here   mmm how much   i'll have to borrow it the lannisters will accommodate i expect we already owe lord tywin 3 million gold what's another 80000  i'm telling you the crown is six million in debt   the master of coin finds the money the king and the hand spend it   as you will but still we'd best make our plans   cat go on go upstairs   i meant no disrespect to you of all people   no one will come looking for you here isn't that what like you wanted i'm truly sorry about the locale  a dear friend told me   well well this is an historic day something you don't know that i do there's only one dagger like this in all of the seven kingdoms it's mine  at least it was until the tournament on prince joffrey's last nameday i bet on ser jaime in the jousting as any sane man would when the knight of the flowers unseated him i lost this dagger   tyrion lannister the imp   good news perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife   is she   i thought that she'd be safest in here one of several such establishments i own  the starks quick tempers slow minds  the mere suggestion that the queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason   which lord tyrion will say was stolen from him the only man who could say otherwise has no throat thanks to your boy's wolf   i'll try to keep you alive for her sake a fool's task admittedly but i've never been able to refuse your wife anything   don't tell anyone i have a reputation to maintain,3,1,343
21,ned, get the girls settled in i'll be back in time for supper and jory you go with them  glad to see you're protecting the throne   very handsome armor not a scratch on it  you've chosen your opponents wisely then   but you just stood there and watched  is that what you tell yourself at night you're a servant of justice that you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in aerys targaryen's back   you served him well when serving was safe  lord varys   a shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son renly you're looking well   she has lord baelish i understand you knew my brother brandon as well  perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with   grand maester  and you served another king   without the king  40000 gold dragons to the champion 20000 to the runner-up 20000 to the winning archer   are you telling me the crown is three million in debt   how could you let this happen   i will not believe jon arryn allowed robert to bankrupt the realm   i'll speak to him tomorrow this tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford   there will be no plans until i speak to robert forgive me my lords i had a long ride   what's happening here   go to your room we'll speak later that's for you love…   the same dollmaker makes all of princess myrcella's toys don't you like it   it's all right go on  war was easier than daughters  arya open the door may i come in whose sword is that   give it to me i know this maker's mark this is mikken's work where did you get this this is no toy little ladies shouldn't play with swords   come here now what do you want with this   a blade with a name and who were you hoping to skewer with needle your sister do you know the first thing about sword fighting  [laughs] that's the essence of it   no sweet girl you didn't kill the butcher's boy   sansa was dragged before the king and queen and asked to call the prince a liar  darling listen to me sansa will be married to joffrey someday she cannot betray him she must take his side even when he's wrong  well… look at me you're a stark of winterfell you know our words  you were born in the long summer you've never known anything else but now winter is truly coming and in the winter we must protect ourselves look after one another sansa is your sister  i don't want to frighten you but i won't lie to you either we've come to a dangerous place we cannot fight a war amongst ourselves all right go on it's yours   try not to stab your sister with it if you're going to own a sword you'd better know how to use it   my wife is in winterfell  you're a funny man a very funny man   it's too dangerous   until we know who our enemies are   littlefinger's right i can't do anything without proof  then i bring it to robert and hope he's still the man i once knew you watch yourself on the road huh that temper of yours is a dangerous thing  he still loves you  off with you,3,1,542
22,old nan,  don't listen to it crows are all liars i know a story about a crow   i know a story about a boy who hated stories i could tell you about ser duncan the tall those were always your favorites  oh my sweet summer child what do you know about fear fear is for the winter when the snows fall a hundred feet deep fear is for the long night when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness that is the time for fear my little lord when the white walkers move through the woods thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation kings froze to death in their castles same as the shepherds in their huts and women smothered their babies rather than see them starve and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks so is this the sort of story that you like in that darkness the white walkers came for the first time they swept through cities and kingdoms riding their dead horses hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds…  only what the little lord wants to hear,3,1,198
23,pycelle, i humbly beg your pardon my lord stark  how many years has it been you were a young man  how forgetful of me this belongs to you now should we begin  can the treasury bear such expense  lord arryn gave wise and prudent advice but i fear his grace doesn't always listen  lord stark i meant to give you this earlier so forgetful these days a raven from winterfell this morning,3,1,71
24,pyp, i wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did,3,1,10
25,rakharo, you walk [to viserys]  dothraki don’t wear steel dresses  armor armor make a man vroz  slow  my father taught me how to fight he taught me that speed defeats size  he was bloodrider to khal bharbo and your father jorah the andal he was a warrior also  there are no rabbits  have you seen any ducks woman no rabbits no ducks do you have eyes in your head do you  a blessing from the great stallion,3,1,76
26,rast, what do you care about our faces,3,1,7
27,renly," and you look tired from the road i told them this meeting could wait another day but  winter may be coming but i'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother  my brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of lord stark's appointment as hand of the king  ""counting coppers"" he calls it",3,1,56
28,rhakaro, we ride for vaes dothrak,3,1,5

30,robert,"  it's been a long time but i still remember every face you remember your first   who was it  how'd you do it  quick one lucky for you mine was some tarly boy at the battle of summerhall my horse took an arrow so i was on foot slogging through the mud he came running at me this dumb high-born lad thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword i knocked him down with the hammer gods i was strong then caved in his breastplate probably shattered every rib he had stood over him hammer in the air right before i brought it down he shouted ""wait wait"" they never tell you how they all shit themselves they don't put that part in the songs stupid boy now the tarlys bend the knee like everyone else he could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable his sons would be ingrates and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl wine lancel gods what a stupid name lancel lannister who named you some halfwit with a stutter what are you doing  what do you mean it's empty   is that what empty means so get more tell your cousin to get in here kingslayer get in here surrounded by lannisters every time i close my eyes i see their blond hair and their smug satisfied faces it must wound your pride huh standing out there like a glorified sentry jaime lannister son of the mighty tywin forced to mind the door while your king eats and drinks and shits and fucks so come on we're telling war stories who was your first kill not counting old men  your outlaw any last words  what about aerys targaryen what did the mad king say when you stabbed him in the back i never asked did he call you a traitor did he plead for a reprieve",3,1,335
31,rodrick, fewer eyes back here my lady but still too many  my lady,3,1,12

20,little finger,  that sounds like someone we know the mountain  i’ve heard him called “tywin lannister’s mad dog” i’m sure you have as well  can you think of any reason the lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife  it would be almost as brazen as attacking the hand of the king in the streets of the capital  a bold move my lord and admirable but is it wise to yank the lion’s tail tywin lannister is the richest man in all the seven kingdoms gold wins wars not soldiers,6,1,90

27,pycelle, brigands most likely  it’s the king’s hand you’re addressing not the king the king is hunting  why should ser gregor turn brigand the man is an anointed knight  if the lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king’s protection it would be -  wel…  my lord… this… this is a drastic action it would be better to wait for king robert’s return  my lord,6,1,66
28,renly, a simpler time  sounds exhilarating  once i think  those were some lucky girls  what days were those the ones where half of westeros fought the other half and millions died or before that when the mad king slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground  i suppose it was all rather heroic if you were drunk enough and had some poor riverlands whore to shove your price inside and “make the eight”,6,1,91
29,robb, not too fast  not now  you’re talking about war  only the lord of winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army  and it’s not your duty because it’s not your house  where’s bran  drop the knife let him go and i’ll let you live  are you all right  have you lost your mind what if you’d missed  you don’t have the right -  what about her  we’ll keep her alive,6,1,72

41,tyrion, you brought this on yourself  do you understand we’re losing the war  it was quite a battle   strange things do happen you should taste her fish pie  men like lord varys and i can't let our disadvantages get the best of us we'll make a fisherman of him yet   your discretion is legendary where your friends are concerned  i don't like threats  i'm not ned stark i understand the way this game is played  and i am not threaten me again and i will have you thrown into the sea  you've perfected the art of tearing up papers give him his father's bones back at least as a gesture of good faith  safe travels cousin  you have a deft hand with diplomacy  lord commander asks that we send more men to man the wall  cold winds are rising and the dead rise with them  according to the commander one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers  mormont doesn't lie  apparently you burn him  i don't know what i believe but here's a fact for you the night's watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the wall  leave us podrick i believe we know how to pour our own wine  myself i prefer the improper ones  you know your wines my lord  call me tyrion please i'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners now that you're a lord  i heard there was some trouble in littlefinger's brothel the other night  yes of course city watch must keep the peace only i hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies  quite right especially the queen's orders  no but who else would want to murder king robert's bastards she's always been a jealous woman  you've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister  that's good of you but you have heard them i suppose people who do believe that filth consider robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than cersei's children  i appreciate your loyalty tell me  the fool he had no idea you were already bought  i'm not questioning your honor lord janos i'm denying its existence  dwarf you should have stopped at imp and yes you will stand here and take it from me unless you'd like to take it from my friend here  i intend to serve as hand of the king until my father returns from the war and seeing as you betrayed the last hand of the king well i just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about  the queen regent and you're a fool to believe she's your friend  no we shan't  there's a ship leaving for east watch by the sea tonight from there i'm afraid it's rather a long walk to castle black i hope you enjoy the wall i found it surprisingly beautiful in a brutal horribly uncomfortable sort of way  his name is bronn and he is the new commander of the city watch  to the new commander  if i told you to murder an infant girl say still at her mother's breast would you do it without question  i have every right i am the king's hand  listen to me queen regent you're losing the people do you hear me  you might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead half the city will starve when winter comes the other half will plot to overthrow you and your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry “the queen slaughters babies”  you don't even have the decency to deny it  it wasn't you who gave the order was it joffrey didn't even tell you or did he tell you i imagine that would be even worse  i'm no king but i think there's more to ruling that that   as has jaime repeatedly according to stannis baratheon  she was my mother too,2,2,641
42,varys, your father has named lord tyrion to  serve as hand in his stead  my lord  we were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the stark auxiliary forces  i heard you suffered a terrible head wound the northerners are such fearsome warriors  to find so lovely creature working in your father's kitchen it almost beggars belief  how can you tell  i am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital friends are such an important part of life unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come but rest easy my lord i am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends  how unspeakable of me to go on and on when all you want to do is rest i will leave you  welcome to kings landing my dear the city is made brighter by your presence we have a council meeting my lord  who threatened you  ned stark was a man of honor  you might be disappointed in the results the storms come and go the big fish eat the little fish and i keep on paddling come my lord we shouldn't keep the queen waiting  trouble with the wildlings  somewhat less wild these days it seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this king-beyond-the-wall  how do you kill a dead man,2,2,222
43,woman, is it as you remember my lord  everything looks bigger when you're a child i remember my father's cabin felt like a palace when i was little now look at it  who will  i love the cold and wet  then you'll be king before long  my father doesn't trust you iron islanders  he says that you're all reavers and rapers and that no matter how many women you have you'll never be satis-  capture me take me with you when you go ashore make me your saltwife  not after you leave father will punish me he'll call me a whore,2,2,100

45,yoren, you're a long way from home  aye you did you asked without manners and i chose not to answer  well the thing is  these gutter rats belong to the night's watch now that puts them beyond the reach of kings and queens  it's a funny thing people worry so much about their throats they forget about what's down low now i sharpened this blade before breakfast i could shave a spider's arse if i wanted to or i could nick this artery in your leg and once it's nicked there's no one around here who knows how to un-nick it  we'll just keep that good steel is always needed on the wall seems you have a choice you can die here at this crossroads a long way from home or you can go back to your city and tell your masters you didn't find what you were looking for,2,2,149

45,stannis, what is it  fools love a fool i grieve for him as well for the boy he was not the man he grew to be  i thought i made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter  i've never known you to need to hear a thing twice  you've come to lecture me on truth  all my brother's bannermen have come to my side except the tyrells who fled like cowards they won't be able to resist us now soon i shall be sitting on the iron throne  i'll hear no more about it  as soon as i've consolidated my troops we'll make short work of the lannisters' fleet once blackwater bay is cleared we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city  that's not your concern  i never thought i'd have reason to doubt your loyalty was i wrong  oh truth again all right what's the truth the hard truth  what do you believe  we set out for king's landing without lady melisandre and you lead the fleet into blackwater bay  most of those lords should consider themselves lucky i don't hang them for treason hard truths cut both ways ser davos,5,2,202
46,theon, you're the crew of the sea bitch i'm your commander welcome  stop stop your captain commands you to stop  the stony shore to raid their villages there'll be spoils in it for you and women if you do your jobs well  i do your captain  you could do that take the ship head out on your own and i will hunt you down drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor  thank you kind of you to come see me off  you'd better get out there wouldn't want her to set sail without you  who are you  why aren't you with the rest of them or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea that would be good for a laugh  and how am i supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages  and yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that i'm a true iron islander  the stony shore's not far from torrhen's square   no we could we could never hold it for more than a few days as soon as winterfell got word that we'd taken torrhen's square the starks would send their men to take it back and then  take me to my ship,5,2,213
47,tyrion," accounts differ most seem to implicate catelyn stark in some way  some say it was one of his own kingsguard while still others say it was stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour  it's not what varys says he says renly's army is flocking to support stannis which would give stannis superiority over us on both land and sea  and i say father raised you to have too much respect for money stannis baratheon is coming for us sooner rather than later  she'll be safer in dorne  it so happens that i am myrcella is a sweet innocent girl and i don't blame her at all for you  schemes and plots are the same thing they are going to attack us we need to be ready  may i ask specifically what the king has in mind  it's important that we talk about this  wildfire you wouldn't lie to me would you cousin  tell me if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true do you think it will make jaime more likely to kill you or less likely when i tell him you're fucking her i mean  the smart money would be on more likely  but then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours  i suppose there's only one way to find out  when did she tell you this  swear to me on what  but i don't care about your life  all right all right enough even torturing you is boring just get out  oh lancel tell my friend bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me  stannis has more infantry more ships more horses what do we have  well i've never actually been able to kill people with it  he hasn't sent a raven in weeks he's very busy being repeatedly humiliated by robb stark is time-consuming we won't be able to hold the city against stannis not the way joffrey's planning on holding it  it's hard to argue with his assessment  the king is a lost cause it's the rest of us i'm worried about now  you have to admire his imagination  what demon monkey  blame me i'm trying to save them  demon monkey  i remember reading an old sailors' proverb ""piss on wildfire and your cock burns off ""  my companion takes issue  how much do you have  my friend remains unconvinced  i'm afraid i have to concur with my advisor wisdom haylene the contents of this room could lay king's landing low you won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer you'll be making it for me",5,2,433
48,tywin, the starks understand winter better than we ever will the cold won't beat them  and i'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments they would report growing discontent amongst the southern lords this is war no one's content we've underestimated the stark boy for too long he has a good mind for warfare his men worship him and as long as he keeps winning battles they'll keep believing he is king in the north you've been waiting for him to fail he is not going to fail not without our help so how do we stop him  yes i think you would reginald and because you're my cousin i might even let you wake from that sleep go i'm sure your wife must miss you  well then you'd better start riding go before i change my mind and send her your head  if your name wasn't lannister you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent go  not wine water we'll be here for some time girl where are you from  and who are the lords of maidenpool remind me  and what is their sigil  a red salmon i think a maidenpool girl would remember that you're a northerner aren't you  good one more time where are you from  and what do they say of robb stark in the north  and  and do you believe them  fetch that water,5,2,232

18,hot pie, you need sour cherries to make it right and the secret is you dry the stones and then you break them with a mallet that's where the real flavor is you crush 'em up real fine and then when you're finished you sprinkle them over the piecrust  how would i know  i saw him  ow  they went riding out the gates a few hours ago  on patrol let go of my ears  what do you want with him anyway  the sour cherries was all crushed up and ready  probably in the piecrust by now in the oven the nice warm oven  the cheese could be better i did get some nice sausages gendry what did he want us to do about those guards  i want to go back to the kitchens,8,2,131

46,tyrion, pod  what are they doing here  no i don't think so  they stay outside  why are you here  the man who cut me lost more than his nose  thanks to father of course it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me  grand maester pycelle made the same joke you must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees  how do you know that  what do i want from him he's my father do i need to want something i'm sure he loves me dearly as any father loves his child his baby boy yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in king's landing i lay here my face split in half but father never came  why do you care what i want from him  slandered when  you did have your guards beat her a girl of nine i believe  she lost an eye if i remember correctly  it's not slander if it's true  why are you so nervous about what i'm going to say to father  any lies in particular  still makes me more clever than you  a number of people in this city want to kill me you're here to protect me  do you grow bored protecting me  poor poor under my patronage you've become a knight you've served as commander of the city watch  i'm sure you filled your pockets  i thought we were friends  how much  double  i don't even know how much i'm paying you now   the badge looks good on you almost as good as it looked on me are you enjoying your new position  i was very happy as hand of the king  it wasn't your bed at the time  occasionally i drank with the harlots  why does everyone assume i want something can't i simply visit with my beloved father my beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield  i organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of harrenhal i led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson the king quivered in fear behind the walls i bled in the mud for our family and as my reward i was trundled off to some dark little cell but what do i want a little bloody gratitude would be a start  i want what is mine by right jaime is your eldest son heir to your lands and titles but he is a kingsguard forbidden from marriage or inheritance the day jaime put on the white cloak he gave up his claim to casterly rock i am your son and lawful heir  it is mine by right  why,1,3,452
47,tywin, am i enjoying it   you brought a whore into my bed  i sent you here to advise the king i gave you real power and authority you chose to spend your days as you always have bedding harlots and drinking with thieves  what do you want tyrion  maester pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal  jugglers and singers require applause you are a lannister do you think i demanded a garland of roses every time i suffered a wound on a battlefield hmm now i have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion so tell me what you want  you want casterly rock   we'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of blackwater bay and when the time is right you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy and if you serve faithfully you will be rewarded with a suitable wife and i would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to casterly rock  why you ask that you who killed your mother to come into the world you are an ill-made spiteful little creature full of envy lust and low cunning men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since i cannot prove that you are not mine and to teach me humility the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him but neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn casterly rock into your whorehouse go now speak no more of your rights to casterly rock go  oh one more thing the next whore i catch in your bed i'll hang,1,3,317

15,jaime, do you know how long it's going to take us to get to king's landing walking through fields and forests  so how shall we pass the time  it's going to be a very dull walk  you know it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute trust me on this people have been serving me since i was born you think lady stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life a week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword  all the good it's done her  how did you come into lady stark's service there's something we can talk about  it had to be recently you weren't with her at winterfell  because i visited winterfell i would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways  were you pledged to stannis  ah renly really he wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal  why i lived with him at court since he was a boy don't forget could hardly escape the little tulip skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks i knew him far better than you  sounds like you quite fancied him  oh gods you did  did you ever tell him no of course not you weren't renly's type i'm afraid  he preferred curly-haired little girls like loras tyrell you're far too much man for him  unless they're about me it's all true about renly his proclivities were the worst kept secret at court it's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks they'd have never got him off it  i don't blame him and i don't blame you either we don't get to choose who we love  no you really can't  he knows who i am  maybe you're right  but what if you're not what if he tells someone  more innocent than lady stark's daughters   it's a tough decision-take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water  anyone can see us on the bridge but cross by water and the current could take us or i could escape down the river  it's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas which will she choose  gambler at heart wouldn't have guessed  i need to rest  i have these you know on your feet when you walk too far what do you call them  corns i never used to get corns of course i used to ride everywhere not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year  this heel is ruined there's no way-   i never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords  ooh you move well for a great beast of a woman  you shouldn't grimace before you lunge it gives away the game  bit of a quandary for you if you kill me you fail lady stark but if you don't kill me i'm going to kill you  you're good graceless but good  see if you were willing to hurt me you might have had me there  we enjoy a good fight gets our juices flowing the flayed man of house bolton a bit gruesome for my taste  let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want,2,3,556
16,jeor, what is this get up tarly is he all right  that's enough tarly i forbid you to die do you hear me  rast you're responsible for him  make sure he gets back alive if he doesn't you don't move on,2,3,40

18,jojen, you can't kill it you know   because the raven is you  i'm unarmed  my sister carries the weapons  you must be summer  i'm jojen reed this is my sister meera we've come a long way to find you brandon and we have much farther to go  you can get inside his head see through his eyes  that's how it begins until you learn to control it you're a warg  a three-eyed raven   we saw him together you haven't forgotten   no the raven is something different something deeper the raven brings the sight   or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away  you didn't dream it you saw it so did i   when i told my father about your father for the first time in my life i saw him cry  yeah  your father told you about the rebellion mine never did but i saw that too   only one thing that matters-you,2,3,162

5,bronn, come on i'm here later come on  tonight then looks like dull reading  it's an opinion i share with some of the finest men i know  unless lord twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he's really up to  she's not bad with second-timers either  pace yourself lad  let me guess he's not a magician   he's stealing it  what's wrong with that  seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne i imagine he'll forgive that debt  i've never borrowed money before i'm not clear on the rules  and what if i don't  but what if i don't  the lad's practically skipping  he's a squire you don't pay him  maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new master of coin  what did you tell them  of course they seemed to like it they're paid to seem to like it  what are you saying these ladies enjoyed him so much they gave him the time for free,3,3,161
6,brynden," why don't you shut your mouth about that damned mill and don't call him ""nephew"" he is your king  you're lucky i'm not your king i wouldn't let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag  martyn is 15 i believe  we seem to be running short of patience here  it often comforts me to think that even in war's darkest days in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening  maybe your father was a stubborn old ox i was surprised when he died didn't think death had the patience  after 30 years of fighting i don't think he remembered what started it he asked me to stop calling myself blackfish he said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with i told him people had been calling me blackfish for so long they don't remember my real name  you mustn't think it we don't know the truth they could be in hiding robb believes they're alive and he must go on believing he's got to remain strong if he's to prevail and you must remain strong for him",3,3,187
7,catelyn, a person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we're at war  i've missed you uncle father missed you too from the day you left maybe he never said it in so many words--  i'm glad you were with him i wish to the gods i had been did you make peace in the end  every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign i'd see him off 'wait for me little cat' he'd say 'wait for me and i'll come back to you' and i would sit at this window every day when the sun came up waiting i wonder how many times did bran or rickon stare across the moors of winterfell waiting for me to return i will never see them again  ,3,3,128

20,jaime,  i hope you're pleased if you had armed me they never would have taken us  i was in chains if you recall our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound  i've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year  you were not beating me  when we make camp tonight you'll be raped more than once none of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman you'd be wise not to resist  they'll knock your teeth out  no i don't think you care about your teeth if you fight them they will kill you do you understand i'm the prisoner of value not you let them have what they want what does it matter  close your eyes pretend they're renly   if i was a woman i'd make them kill me but i'm not thank the gods  you know who she is don't you  she's brienne of tarth her father is lord selwyn tarth heard of tarth  they call it the sapphire isle do you know why every sapphire in westeros was mined on tarth sapphires are gemstones the blue ones  lord selwyn would pay his daughter's weight in sapphires if she's returned to him but only if she's alive her honor unbesmirched  not defiled  i hated to read as a child but my father forced me to study the books every morning before i could practice with sword or horse two hours every day holed up in the maester's chambers i learned a lot of fancy words  fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding  now that we're speaking together man to man i wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree i'm not asking to be freed from my constraints but if i could sleep lying down my back would thank you for it i'm not as young and resilient as i was once  i'm famished actually  well i do like partridge   my father--   don't,3,3,337

53,tyrion, intimate lovely table better chairs than the old small council chamber conveniently close to your own quarters i like it  far be it from me to hinder true love but lord baelish's absence would present certain problems the royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory summer has ended hard days lie ahead not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended  master of coin  i'm quite good at spending money but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it  a surprising place to keep the royal ledgers  not for bastards  pod pod take them outside i'll be there in a moment  only my life not all that significant i'm afraid  if only the master of coin had such power  oh that of course a simple misunderstanding  we don't i did fuck her once   but we don't  why don't you ask her any advice for me on my new position  if i had a gold dragon for every time i heard that joke i'd be richer than you are  good point  i've tried quite a few well lots of work to do enjoy the eyrie  you think all reading is dull reading  the secret history of the seven kingdoms is written in these pages  unless he made it all up yes  podrick do keep up   podrick  after a long consultation with my colleague ser bronn i finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable tell me pod have you ever been with a woman   wonderful genna specializes in first-timers  a fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face wouldn't you say  now as it happens marei is quite the spear handler herself she's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me  kayla is famous from here to volantis in certain circles one of four women in the world who can perform a proper meereenese knot   she's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as 'my lord  be back in time for my supper  for years i've heard that littlefinger is a magician whenever the crown needs money he rubs his hands together and poof mountains of gold  no  worse he's borrowing it  we can't afford to pay it back that's what's wrong with it the crown owes millions to my father  forgive a debt my father for a man of the world you're strangely naive  well ahem the basic principle is i lend you money and after an agreed upon period of time you return it with interest  well you have to  this is why i don't lend you money anyway it's not my father i'm worried about it's the iron bank of braavos we owe them tens of millions if we fail to repay these loans the bank will fund our enemies one way or another they always get their gold back  ah the return of the conquering hero does he have a little jaunt in his step  you were gone a long time i trust you got your money's worth or should i say my money's worth  oh it was a gift podrick this is more than i give you in a year  oh then it's much more than i give you in a year  have you ever known a whore to turn down gold they were happy enough to take it when i gave it to them   what did you do to them  and they seemed to like these things  only they weren't paid  is that what you're telling us  {podrick doesn't deny it  sit down podrick  we're going to need details copious details,3,3,629
54,tywin, what news of jaime  20000 unwashed northerns have known about his escape for weeks collectively you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is   try harder what do we have then   well let him have it the name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble the lord of harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow arryn  you'll leave for the eyrie as soon as possible and bring lysa arryn into the fold then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him  fully agreed which is why i'm naming you new master of coin   it would appear to be a position that best suits your talents,3,3,144
55,varys, we are trying my lord  robb stark and most of his bannermen are in riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather lord hoster tully in stark's absence roose bolton holds harrenhal which would seem to make him lord of harrenhal in practice if not in name,3,3,46

14,grenn, when people talk about the night's watch they never mention the shoveling  they tell you about honor pardoning crimes and protecting the realm but shoveling really is most of it  but when you're not getting attacked or killed usually you're shoveling  when the lord commander says we go we go  craster's been out here surviving  didn't think a broke foot could kill a man,4,3,64

19,jof, rhaenyra targaryen was murdered by her brother or rather his dragon it ate her while her son watched what's left of her is buried in the crypts right down there  over there in that urn the ashes of aerion targaryen aerion brightflame they called him he thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon  he was wrong and of course there's the mad king killed by my uncle would you like to see where the last targaryens are buried  the tomb's just up here  my father didn't want them here he was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the blackwater but the high septon convinced him otherwise  i couldn't agree more  open the doors,4,3,118

28,margaery,   oh no it's quite all right your grace i'd love to see their tombs really it's like taking a walk through history  this is so exciting    i'm glad he did i'm sorry your grace i know they did terrible things at the end but their ancestors built this sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness  shall we go and see them if you give them your love they will return it a thousandfold i've spoken with them i know how they feel about you you led the defense of king's landing they adore you  ahem i didn't mean to disturb you  we'd like some privacy please if you wouldn't mind waiting back inside the keep or if you'd be kind enough to give me your names i'll ask the king to speak with you himself  what did you pray for  why not i'll tell you what i prayed for in the sept this morning let's see for my family's health and happiness for an end to the war for a short winter boring and traditional i'm afraid and you  my cousin alanna was the most beautiful girl i'd ever seen when i was 12 i was all elbows and knees and alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me pig-face she called me  i think it had something to do with my nose whenever she passed me in the halls she'd oink  so i prayed that she'd catch a horrible skin disease a week after that she came down with porridge plague  you don't have it in the north your skin starts to look like boiled oats and eventually your face slides off and you die in agony    don't say that no you're not  oh she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea it's all terribly frustrating  i want us to be friends good friends  you must see highgarden you'd love it there i know you would we have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon you should see the costumes people work on them for months  the queen regent you mean once i marry joffrey i'll be queen and if you were to marry loras    oh your place would be at highgarden wouldn't it we would be sisters you and i would you like that,4,3,400
29,missandei, the master says they are untested he says you would be wise to blood them early there are many small cities between here and there cities ripe for sacking should you take captives the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price  and who knows in 10 years some of the boys you send them may be unsullied in their turn thus all shall prosper    it is done  you hold the whip,4,3,75
30,olenna,  there appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else  no the rest are there to look adoringly upon the 700 to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats  you were married here your grace  must seem like only yesterday  your husband was he buried here as well  such a tragedy  i should say not my son's a hunter it helps him forget he's never been within a mile of a real battle  all he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent  i told him to stay out of robert's rebellion he had no business fighting an actual warrior we mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave but they do seem to yearn for it we shower them with good sense and it slides right off like rain off a wing  a ridiculous arrangement to my mind  another golden rose how original i eat from plates stamped with roses i sleep in sheets embroidered with roses i have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot as if that makes it smell any better roses are boring dear 'growing strong' ha the dullest words of any house 'winter is coming' now that's memorable 'we do not sow' strong strong those are houses you watch out for direwolves and krakens fierce beasts but a golden rose growing strong--ha that strikes fear in the heart  look little loves a spider in the garden run along now grow strong  the city is made brighter by my presence is that your usual line lord varys are you here to seduce me  oh no please seduce away it's been so long though i rather think it's all for naught what happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit a question for the philosophers but you've come mincing all this way for something so  no come i've heard you're such a clever man i'm curious why you've sought me out  have i because i spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you why shouldn't i take an interest she's an interesting girl  no not particularly but she's had an interesting childhood  come come you surrender rather easily walk with me i know the walls have ears but apparently the shrubbery does too  which is sansa stark  yes ned stark had many admirers and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head  how  that's hardly surprising she's a beautiful girl with a famous name  it almost feels as if you're about to arrive at the point  and why have you come to me with this matter    and if littlefinger marries her he'll have the key in his pocket  you must despise him you're working so hard to undermine him  you are a clever man lord varys  one doesn't need to be clever for that it's all rather obvious isn't it,4,3,496
31,ramsay, not far my lord your sister is waiting for you there  yes i served them the men who were torturing you i did what they told me and waited for the right moment  i grew up on saltcliffe my lord i was only a boy when they took you away my father brought me and my brothers up to the bluffs so we could watch the ship that carried you off i remember the look on my father's face when he told us 'that's balon greyjoy's last living son' and those are the words i heard over and over again when i saw what they were doing to you  not all those are your sister's men some of them are loyal to your father   what is it  what did he tell you to do  he lorded it over you  the stark boys  maybe it's not too late  not everything my lord she's up here  shh wait  i brought him back he killed the others  put him back where he belongs,4,3,170
32,rast, we need to get out of here  the lord commander told us to go to the fist of the first men how'd that turn out for us  we do now we know what's out there  so he's your new protector now our good friend craster  mormont isn't gonna save you this lummox here isn't gonna save you when the walkers come calling craster will serve us up like so many pigs if we want to live we'll have to look out for ourselves  it wasn't his foot that killed him that bastard craster starved him to death  you on his side  the day we leave craster will tap a barrel of our wine and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes and laugh at us starving in the snow he's a bloody wildling is all he is  he's sitting there drinking our wine eating his fill while we die  so you admit you've got a hidden larder then how else'd you make it through winter  you're a stingy bastard  run fast piggy and sleep well i'll be cutting your throat one of these nights,4,3,186
33,ros, no larger than usual apparently and yet they said that he was--  the most extraordinary man they've ever had and they've had a lot of men    i don't know my lord the girls are usually quite descriptive  they said it was hard to describe  he was too preoccupied to notice he's leaving for the eyrie soon i'm helping him prepare for his journey  he hasn't spoken to her since the last time as far as i know but i don't think he's lost interest  his shipboard inventory  former profession  two featherbeds he's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin  he's not interested in them my lord  because i'm one of his girls,4,3,111
34,sam, i'm sorry he's beautiful  he's beautiful  does he have a name  are you going to give him one  gilly  i wanted you to have it  craster's got his daughters to feed  we can't just show up and steal all his food we're brothers of the night's watch not thieves  quickly quickly  no we have to go now,4,3,57
35,sansa, you haven't  i can't tell you  i'm sorry i just can't  pig-face that's ridiculous    porridge plague  but that's awful  so what happened to alanna  i'm sure she's jealous of you now you'll be married here in the capital and she'll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you're queen  that would make me very happy  ,4,3,58
36,theon, how far is it to deepwood motte  she sent you to save me  why would you risk your life for me  those men they said my father knew what they were doing to me did he  my sister's men are loyal to her we don't need to hide from them    i was just thinking how jealous i was when my father told yara to take this place  raid fishing villages he didn't trust me thought i was a stark ha i could never be a stark robb stark always reminded me of that  didn't have to all he had to do was be be who he was born to be his life fit him better than his clothes how could someone like that ever be a brother to me he's the king in the north  and me my father gave me a choice and i made it i could never be a stark but ironborn that's what i was born to be i paid the iron price for winterfell i murdered those boys  never found them just some poor orphans living with a farmer i let dagmer slit their throats and i let him burn the bodies so i could keep winterfell and make my father proud  it is my real father lost his head at king's landing i made a choice and i chose wrong and now i've burned everything down  yara  what no i didn't  you can't no please stop no,4,3,243
37,thoros, i do apologize little lady but it's better for you if you don't see where we're going  blackstrap rum  not easy finding molasses in wartime  let's go home  somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling  you'll die soon enough dog but it won't be murder only justice  house clegane was built upon dead children i saw them lay prince aegon and princess rhaenys before the iron throne,4,3,67
38,tyrion, i hope we might speak in confidence  about the events of the blackwater perhaps this is the wrong time  i thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to--  i didn't inherit littlefinger's spies along with his position i'm afraid which is why i'm coming to you i need proof  i need to know  i don't know do i  yes ahem i feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed which will require a degree of influence which--  the sorcerer,4,3,93
39,tywin, you wanted to speak to me  what about him  when catelyn stark took tyrion prisoner what did i do in response  and if i would start a war for that lecherous little stump what do you think i am doing for my oldest son and heir  whatever i can  you're still here  why  all right contribute  the tyrells helped us defeat stannis baratheon the tyrells saved your life your children's lives  good i wish you knew how to manipulate him i don't distrust you because you're a woman i distrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are you've allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city  i will,4,3,118
40,varys, oh lord tyrion come in come in  oh always in confidence  oh no it's a wonderful time  end your life  proof will there be a trial  i have no proof only whispers before all this nastiness i was going to tell you the story of how i was cut do you want to hear it still  as a boy i travelled with a troupe of actors through the free cities one day in myr a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse i feared the man meant to use me as i'd heard some men used small boys but what he wanted was far worse he gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak yet did nothing to dull my senses with a hooked blade he sliced me root and stem chanting all the while he burned my parts in a brazier the flames turned blue and i heard a voice answer his call i still dream of that night not of the sorcerer not of his blade i dream of the voice from the flames was it a god a demon a conjuror's trick i don't know but the sorcerer called and a voice answered and ever since that day i have hated magic and all those who practice it but you can see why i was eager to aid in your fight against stannis and his red priestess a symbolic revenge of sorts  you do not possess at the moment  but influence is largely a matter of patience i have found once i had served the sorcerer's purpose he threw me out of his house to die i resolved to live to spite him i begged i sold what parts of my body remained to me i became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse step by step one distasteful task after another i made my way from the slums of myr to the small council chamber influence grows like a weed i tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the red keep all the way across to the far side of the world where i managed to wrap them around something very special  hello my old friend it's been a long time i have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it  is he very large  extraordinary  we're talking about the same podrick the quiet boy in lord tyrion's service seems a bit simple  what did he do to them  so what did they say  huh prodigies appear in the oddest of places and what did littlefinger say about this loss of income  ah yes to pursue his enduring love of the lady arryn and the title that comes with her sad really is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor sansa stark  what makes you say so  ah you can read rare for a woman in your profession  of course i'm missing something obvious you're about to point out  who is important enough to littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides littlefinger could he be bringing one of his girls  how do you know  prodigies in odd places indeed  my lady i wanted to personally welcome you to king's landing the city has been made brighter by your presence  a little obvious perhaps  might i sit  you've taken an interest in sansa stark  is she  she has sadly well forgive me for wasting your time then i thought we shared certain hopes for her well-being  i choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still  neither a babe in the woods i admired her father  i could not help lord stark perhaps i can help his daughter  you're not the only one who has taken an interest in her  indeed she'd make a lovely match for the right suitor  littlefinger is not long for the capital a confidant of mine has told me that when he goes sansa stark goes with him  littlefinger was born with no lands no wealth no armies he has acquired the first two how long before he has the army  perhaps you'll laugh but i know him better than most and this is the truth littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in westeros if robb stark falls sansa stark is the key to the north  which seems such a shame why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride  actually i rather enjoy him but he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes  you are too kind i believe i have a possible solution,4,3,796

17,jon, you ever climbed it before  aren't you  you kill someone for them  can we not talk about that here  did i seem scared the other day  only in the beginning  what secret  i won't        take my hand,6,3,37
18,little finger, there aren't there aren't even 200 i've counted  early days my friend it is flattering really you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what i want  you're so right for instance when i thwarted your plan to give sansa stark to the tyrells if i'm going to be honest i did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there but your confidant the one who fed you information about my plans the one you swore to protect you didn't bring her any enjoyment and she didn't bring me any enjoyment she was a bad investment on my part luckily i have a friend who wanted to try something new something daring and he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience  the realm do you know what the realm is it's the thousand blades of aegon's enemies a story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie  chaos isn't a pit chaos is a ladder   many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again the fall breaks them   and some are given a chance to climb but they refuse they cling to the realm or the gods or love illusions only the ladder is real the climb is all there is,6,3,217
19,loras, oh it's more of a brooch really though i suppose a brooch is a sort of pin so  uh yes i-i am as well  yes me too definitely i've dreamed of a large wedding since i was quite young the guests the food the tournaments and the bride of course the most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves have you ever been to highgarden my lady  it's terrible isn't it the most terrible place there is,6,3,87
20,lothar, our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the north can continue if his terms are met lord frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters  19,6,3,41
21,maid, lady sansa lord tyrion to see you should i--,6,3,9

23,meera, i know how to skin a rabbit  i didn't see any game before i got here  well i made this bow myself guess you don't learn how to do that north of the wall  oh you're gonna punch the rabbits to death  well someone else is sitting right here  well some of us would say thank you when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them or don't they teach you to say thank you north of the wall  your way of skinning rabbits is quicker than mine  thank you see not so hard is it thank you  shh i'm right here with you  i'm right here with you  the visions take their toll  ,6,3,114
24,melisandre, we come as friends  valar morghulis   you are thoros of myr   the high priest gave you a mission turn king robert away from his idols and towards the lord of light what happened   you quit you mean the heathen continue to slaughter each other and you continue to get drunk  how many times has the lord brought him back   that's not possible   you should not have this power  you've been to the other side  you have someone he needs  you are more than they can ever be they're just foot soldiers in the great war you will make kings rise and fall,6,3,102
25,olenna, impossible  my grandson is the pride of highgarden the most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms your daughter--  old  old i'm something of an expert on the subject her change will be upon her before long i'll spare you the details of what will happen then you men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter but this is another matter entirely  oh not at all a sword swallower through and through  did you grow up with boy cousins lord tywin sons of your father's bannermen squires stable boys  and you never--  not once not in any way  i congratulate you upon your restraint but it's a natural thing two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets  lie or not you must admit many people find it quite convincing convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill lannisters and tyrells thanks to our new affiliation  as an authority on myself i must disagree  and if cersei is too old to give loras children we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt it is a chance we simply cannot take  oh  you would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you,6,3,200
26,orell, your flock gets smaller every year  no  we've gotta cut them loose,6,3,12
27,osha, that's not how you skin a rabbit  not by the looks of it  you grow up north of the wall you learn the proper way to handle game  if i had a bow i could have shot a dozen rabbits  you learn how to use your fists though  i had someone else in mind  some of us are just a little better  you've got a big mouth girl and too many teeth  lady reed here's got a stick so far up her ass it's a wonder her feet touch the ground  me it's my fault first time i met her she put a knife to my throat  i said so didn't i  you're a good little hunter  don't push me,6,3,120
28,ramsay, sorry were you sleeping  wa-- wa-- water you want some water i wish i had some for you  so let's play a game which body part do you need the least  please is not a body part  but you've already told me everything remember your daddy was mean to you the starks didn't appreciate you one good bit though the stark boys they're still alive wouldn't that be a hunt to remember you failed but i'm a better hunter than you  now how about your little finger you don't use that for much do you no good let's start with that  you've been wondering why you're here haven't you where you are who i am why i'm doing this to you so guess if you guess right i'll tell you by the old gods and the new i swear it you win the game if you can figure out who i am and why i'm torturing you and i win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger  if you think this has a happy ending you haven't been paying attention  you say please again and you'll wish you hadn't you first where are we  too vague  terrible guess  now where  do i look like a fucking umber to you  karhold how did you know that did you see any banners flying when we came in  very good lord theon and who am i  he's dead strangled by the kingslayer  you're right  yes you win  of course you forgot to ask one question you forgot to ask if i'm a liar  i'm afraid i am  everything i told you is a lie  i win,6,3,277
29,rickon, what's happening  what's wrong with him,6,3,6
30,robb, thank you for riding here so quickly i know travel isn't easy in these times  we are fighting for the north harrenhal is not in the north it is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it  we will do whatever we can to give lord frey what he needs  he has every right to be please excuse us while we discuss it  he's a proud man and we've wounded him  it's all right you heard him if you refuse our alliance with the freys is dead  i have a war to fight we can't win it without them i have no time to haggle you said you wanted to make amends for the stone mill  i've won every battle but i'm losing this war if we don't do this and do it now we're lost  you're paying for my sins uncle it's not fair or right i'll remember it,6,3,157
31,roose bolton, i see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear  i should send you back to robb stark  wars cost money many people would pay a great deal for you  you're right perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies  king robb is keeping your father quite busy he doesn't have time for anything else  as soon as you're well enough to travel i will allow you to go to king's landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made and you will swear to tell your father the truth that i had nothing to do with your maiming  i don't partake  oh she won't be going with you  you are charged with abetting treason  you're in no place to insist on anything i would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position,6,3,144
32,sam, but the more wood the bigger the fire  huh you know your fires  it doesn't get so cold down in the reach and there were servants of course  oh i found something at the fist of the first men buried treasure thousands of years old i think  i'm not sure that it does anything it's beautiful though isn't it  not so far a few more days  bigger so big you can't even see the top sometimes it's hidden in clouds  i'm not it's 700 feet high all made of ice on a warm day you can see it weeping castle black is nice enough they keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night and hobb makes venison stew with onions very tasty sometimes one of the brothers will sing dareon sings best  no no no no not very well  oh all right let's see  oh ahem  the father's face is stern and strong / he sits and judges right from wrong / he weighs our lives the short and long / and loves the little children / the mother gives the gift of life / and watches over every wife / her gentle smile ends all strife  /and she loves her little children,6,3,206
33,sansa, that's a wonderful pin   i'm very happy about  i feel like i'm in a dream  no i had never left winterfell before i came to king's landing but it sounds wonderful i can't wait to see it and to leave this place  do you think people will like it  you're right it's not my wedding anyway from what i can tell the dressmakers in highgarden will be far superior to the ones in king's landing they'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding loras likes green and gold brocade  will they let me invite my family  but do you think they will  good afternoon lord tyrion i was just trying on a gown for king joffrey's wedding  of course  shae please excuse her lord tyrion she's not from here but i trust her even though she tells me not to  it's all right really,6,3,148
34,shae, i don't think they will even notice it  i'm sure he does  they haven't asked my opinion  no  why do you need to speak to her alone,6,3,27
35,theon, wa--    please  i'll tell you everything please    if i win you'll let me go  please  the north  deepwood motte  last hearth  karhold  no it was just a guess  torrhen karstark  he was your brother your father is lord rickard karstark  you swore to tell me if i--  lord rickard karstark is robb stark's bannerman i betrayed robb that's why you're torturing me      please cut it off cut it off cut it off,6,3,72
36,thoros, valar dohaeris  i don't see many priestesses of r'hollor in the riverlands     i failed   you worship him in your way and i'll worship him in mine do you speak the common tongue  my friends here don't speak high valyrian why are you here my lady  lucky for the ladies  six   the lord has smiled upon me   i have no power i ask the lord for his favor and he responds as he will  i've always been a terrible priest drank too much rum fucked all the whores in king's landing it's a terrible thing to say but by the time i came to westeros i didn't believe in our lord i decided that he that all the gods were stories we told the children to make them behave so i wore the robes and every now and then i'd recite the prayers but it was just for show a spectacle for the locals until the mountain drove a lance through this one's heart i knelt beside his cold body and said the old words not because i believed in them but he was my friend and he was dead and they were the only words i knew and for the first time in my life the lord replied beric's eyes opened and i knew the truth our god is the one true god and all men must serve him  we're doing it for both girl we can't defend the people without weapons and horses and food and we can't get weapons and horses and food without gold,6,3,257
37,tormund, used to be you couldn't find a tree within a mile of the wall crows would come out every morning with axes  sink your metal deep and make sure it holds before taking your next step and if you fall don't scream you don't want that to be the last thing she remembers  look out  just seeing if you can take a hit lad      no,6,3,65
38,tyrion, i don't suppose there's anything we can do about this  it's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement probably sansa though loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery  on a boat you built  i'm your family a member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival whether or not you or father or anyone else wants to admit it  trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you there are two people in king's landing who can give an order to a kingsguard did you or did you not order ser mandon to kill me during the battle of the blackwater  the impulse i understand he hates me because i'm the only one who tells him what he really is so fair enough he wants me dead but his stupidity he could have had me poisoned and no one would have known but the king orders a kingsguard to murder the hand of the king in full view of his own army the boy's an idiot  i want you to tell me if my life is still in danger  seven kingdoms united in fear of tywin lannister  you may escape at least once jaime gets back ser loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels  jaime or not i'm truly fucked  i beg your pardon my lady  yes it should be quite a wedding i need to speak with you lady sansa  alone if i may  sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances,6,3,288
39,tywin, why  is rich the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king  old  the years punish us as well i promise you that my stomach remains quite strong however the only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities do you deny them  and a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name  of course  no  never  perhaps highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior  i will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it  i don't care what people believe and neither do you  now if the rumors about my children were true then joffrey is no king at all and house tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt  the uncertainty makes you uncomfortable all right i'll remove it for you  if you refuse to marry loras to cersei i will name him to the kingsguard i'm sure you're familiar with the kingsguard vows he will never marry he will never have children  the tyrell name will fade and highgarden will go to the children of joffrey and margaery  i would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously so shall i draw up the order or do you consent to this marriage,6,3,232
40,varys, 1000 blades taken from the hands of aegon's fallen enemies forged in the fiery breath of balerion the dread  ha i'm sure you have ugly old thing yet it has a certain appeal the lysa arryn of chairs shame you had to settle for your second choice  thwarting you has never been my primary ambition i promise you although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then  i did what i did for the good of the realm  but what do we have left once we abandon the lie chaos a gaping pit waiting to swallow us all,6,3,101
41,ygritte, no but tormund's done it half a hundred times you're afraid  aye it's a long way up and a long way down but i've waited my whole life to see the world from up there here sit down  i brought a pair for you they're too big for you but they're good  nah i didn't kill him but i bet his balls are still bruised  he wasn't good to me the way you're good to me he didn't do that thing you do with your tongue  'can we not talk about that here i'm jon snow i've killed dead men and qhorin halfhand but i'm scared of naked girls'  you were trembling like a leaf  only in the beginning you're a proper lover jon snow and don't worry your secret's safe with me  do you think i'm as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up you're loyal and you're brave you didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into mance rayder's tent  but i'm your woman now jon snow you're going to be loyal to your woman the night's watch don't care if you live or die mance rayder don't care if i live or die we're just soldiers in their armies and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down  it's you and me that matters to me and you don't ever betray me  'cause i'll cut your pretty cock right off and wear it 'round my neck  you staring at my ass jon snow  you all right        ,6,3,258
0,anguy, spotted a lannister raiding party  no more than 20  less than a day's ride south,7,3,15

17,jof, grandfather   yes i'd like a report on the meetings of my small council  i've been very busy many important matters require a king's attention  you've been holding the council meetings in the tower of the hand instead of the small council chamber  may i ask why  so if i wanted to attend a council meeting i would now have to climb all the stairs in the tower of the hand  tell me about the targaryen girl in the east and her dragons  is it true  don't you think we ought to do something about it  and the biggest was the size of a carriage  but how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel  but i haven't been counseled  i should be consulted about such things,7,3,137
18,jojen, that's where we are  i don't fill his head with anything   what's happening to him and what that means  it's not like that i wish i could tell him all the answers it would be much easier  we're not going to castle black   i told you already jon snow isn't there bran needs to find the raven beyond the wall,7,3,60
19,jon,  about a week i think   when we went to castle black we took the kingsroad   most of the time yes   they don't really it's a great honor to carry your house sigil   usually it's the young boys banging the drums  they help the men march  no no you're just gonna light the biggest fire the north has ever seen to let them know you're coming  i know you cut me loose on the wall  and are you gonna share it with me the deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird  you're gonna scare it off  it's too far away   it's a windmill   just the men who used to live here  winterfell has towers three times that size  if you're impressed by a windmill you'd be swooning if you saw the great keep at winterfell   fainting   when a girl sees blood and collapses   well not all girls are like you  i'd like to see you in a silk dress   so i could tear it off you  maybe one day i'll take you to winterfell  ygritte you won't win i know your people are brave no one denies that  six times in the last thousand years a king has attacked the kingdoms six times they failed   every boy in the north knows it we grow up learning it where the battles were fought the names of the heroes who died where six times you've invaded and six times you've failed the seventh will be the same  you don't have the discipline you don't have the training your army is no army you don't know how to fight together  i do i know it if you attack the wall you'll die all of you  yes first we'll live,7,3,288
20,jorah, yunkai the yellow city  on the field with ease but they won't meet us on the field they have provisions patience and strong walls if they're wise they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us man by man  we don't need yunkai khaleesi taking this city will not bring you any closer to westeros or the iron throne   200000 if not more   i don't know,7,3,67

15,jon, he breeds them for the watch  the watch protects him  we just take the horses and go  the old man’s no threat  the watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief  they’ll send a lot more to hunt down murderers  ygritte  you were right the whole time,9,3,50

30,roslin, lord edmure i hope i’m not a disappointment to you,9,3,10
31,samwell, we're west of castle black but the nightfort's closest to us  it was the first castle on the wall the watch abandoned it during the reign of king jaehaerys i  too big impossible to maintain  other than castle black itself the nightfort's the perfect castle for us  it's got a secret sally port the black gate as old as the wall itself  no one's used it for centuries most likely  it leads through the wall right down into the nightfort if no one knows how to find it which it just so happens i do  i read about it in a very old book  yes,9,3,105
32,septon, you may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection  in the sight of the seven i hereby seal these two souls binding them as one for eternity  look upon each other and say the words,9,3,38
33,talisa, [looking at the band and talking to lothar] they’re good aren’t they  your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman i’ve ever met  and i like her  but if she had her way i would be back in volantis playing my harp and you would be sitting over there [looks at edmure and roslin] eating blackberries out of roslin frey’s hand  no don’t  don’t insult them  that is a very strange custom  it seems normal to you  no but there are other ways of providing proof  i don’t know  but if it’s a boy i know what we should name him  eddard [catches robb by surprise] don’t you want to teach little ned stark how to ride horses,9,3,121

35,tormund, what’s one old man doing with eight horses  and proper steel  i hope so  killing crows in their castle is tough  killing them out here in the open that’s what we do  spread out  surround the hut and move in  clear the barn  thunder  maybe it's ghosts  that won’t help you grandpa  where you riding  no it doesn’t matter now  you understand  go on boy  go on  kill him  he’s one of them  do you hear me  you’re not gonna die for one of them,9,3,85

37,together, khuu khuu khuu,8,4,3
38,tyrion," wine always helps i thank you for it trial by combat deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces tells you something about the gods how much longer  do you think oberyn has a chance the red viper of dorne you don't get a name like that unless you're deadly right  oh he's going to die i'm going to die  that's putting it mildly what's the punishment for regicide drawing and quartering hanging breaking at the wheel  seems rather ordinary and he was my nephew as well so what is that fratricide is brothers filicide is sons nepoticide that's the one matricide patricide infanticide suicide there's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word  cousins you're right there is no word for cousin killing well done do you remember cousin orson orson lannister  simple used to sit all day in the garden crushing beetles with a rock  nothing made him happier  on the contrary laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else  for you you drifted away  yes other interests but i stayed with orson  i was curious why was he smashing all those beetles what did he get out of it first thing i did was ask him ""orson why are you smashing all those beetles"" he gave me an answer ""smash the beetles smash 'em khuu khuu khuu"" i wasn't deterred i was the smartest person i knew certainly i had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron so i went to maester volarik's library  turns out far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons doesn't seem right in any case i found nothing that illuminated the nature of orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter so i went back to the source i may not have been able to speak with orson but i could observe him watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior *picks up a beetle* and as i watched i became more and more sure of it there was something happening there his face was like the page of a book written in a language i didn't understand but he wasn't mindless he had his reasons and i became possessed with knowing what they were i began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him i would eat my lunch in the garden chewing my mutton to the music of ""khuu khuu khuu"" and when i wasn't watching him i was thinking about him father droned on about the family legacy and i thought about orson's beetles i read the histories of targaryen conquests did i hear dragon wings no i heard ""khuu khuu khuu"" and i still couldn't figure out why he was doing it and i had to know because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason  i know i know but still it filled me with dread piles and piles of them years and years of them how many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt in my dreams i found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see i woke up crying weeping for their shattered little bodies i tried to stop orson once  he just pushed me aside with a ""khuu"" and kept on smashing every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him *puts the beetle back on the ground* so what do you think why did he do it what was it all about  looks like very light armor  you could at least wear a helmet you shouldn't drink before a fight  it could get you killed it could get me killed  thank the gods",8,4,663

2,brienne, us the only reason you’re here is that jaime lannister told me you weren’t safe in the capital you’re hundreds of miles from king’s landing no one knows what you look like no one cares you’re safe  do you even know what a squire is  i’m not a knight that means you’re not a squire  i don’t care i’m not your mother  i found arya she didn’t want my protection  will you shut your mouth i didn’t ask for advice i don’t want anyone following me i’m not a leader all i ever wanted is to fight for a lord i believed in the good lords are dead and the rest are monsters,1,5,113
3,cersei, why not  he’ll never know we’ve been gone  you don’t need to be afraid of my father  yes  of course we should  no  they said that you were terrifying with cat’s teeth and three eyes you’re not terrifying you’re boring  i know you’re a witch and you can see the future tell me mine  this is my father’s land my land tell me my future or i’ll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head  i’ve been promised to the prince when will we marry  but i will be queen  will the king and i have children  that doesn’t make sense  they will keep waiting i want a moment alone with him  they will wait  he never wanted you to be a king’s guard but here you are protecting his dead body  they  they had nothing to do with it the man who murdered our father he tore us apart he’s the enemy i’ve been telling you for years you’ve been defending him for years…  and now our father is dead and that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath did you set him free  tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose you killed him by mistake with stupidity you’re a man of action aren’t you when it occurs to you to do something you do it nevermind the consequences take a look  look at the consequences here they are he loved you more than anyone in this world  thank you so much for your kind words  cousin lancel i hardly recognized you  uncle it’s quite alright  i’m sure he’ll grow out of it whatever it is excuse me  your wounds from the blackwater seem to have healed  what can i do for you  what could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness  i doubt you’ve ever led anyone anywhere  i don’t know what you’re talking about  the day tywin lannister’s soul needs your help…,1,5,326
4,daario, you should reopen the fighting pits  my mother was a whore i told you that she liked to drink pear brandy the older she got the less she made selling her body the more she wanted to drink so one day when i was 12 she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before  i was a bad child i wasn’t big but i was quick and i loved to fight so they sold me to a man in tolos who trained fighters for the pits i had my first match when i was 16  i’m only here because of those pits i learned to fight like a dothraki screamer a norvoshi priest a westerosi knight soon i was famous 10000 men and women screamed my name when i stepped into the pit i made so much money for my master he set me free when i died i joined the second sons and then i met you  you’re the queen everyone’s too afraid of you to speak truth everyone but me you’ve made thousands of enemies all across the world as soon as they see weakness they’ll attack show your strength here now  anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of unsullied you’re not the mother of unsullied you’re the mother of dragons  a dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen,1,5,230
5,daario naharis, when did the unsullied start patrolling the streets of meereen looks like your friends haven’t been behaving themselves,1,5,18
6,daenerys, sons of the harpy  they’ve never killed before  i didn’t conquer them their own people did  then they will have to learn to see things differently mossador he did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away and i did not take up residence in this pyramid so i could watch the city below decline into chaos what was the name of the man you lost  i want him buried with honor publicly in the temple of the graces  angry snakes lash out makes chopping off their heads that much easier find the men who did this and bring them to me  good  concessions  i’m not a politician i’m a queen  i don’t expect the wise masters to be happy slavery made them rich i ended slavery  the fighting pits where slaves fought slaves to the death  no fighting pits  i do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting  how many times must i say no before you understand  whatever he wants from me he’s not going to get it if he really believes i’m going to reopen the fighting pits…  what  why  you were sold into slavery forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters and you’re defending the fighting pits  that’s why i have the unsullied patrolling the streets  i don’t want another child’s bones dropped at my feet no one’s seen drogon in weeks for all i know he’s flown halfway across the world i can’t control them anymore  viserion rhaegal  easy easy easy,1,5,258
7,davos, i’ve been talking to your sworn brothers many of them love you  many don’t you were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the wall why  some of the night’s watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings  it’s a fair offer more than fair,1,5,50
8,gilly, shouldn’t you be training too  that one hates me  don’t let them send us away  sam don’t let them send us away  you can’t leave they’ll execute you,1,5,28
9,grey worm, white rat your grace  missandei hin naath  why do you come  i do not know i must go,1,5,18
10,hizdahr, they did ask for some concessions  politics is the art of compromise your grace  forgive me you’re right of course still it’s easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones  they do not ask for the return of slavery they ask for the re-opening of the fighting pits  in the new world that you’ve brought to us free men would fight free men  the pitfighters that you liberated plead for this opportunity bring some here and ask them yourself  opening them would show the people of yunkai and meereen that you respect their traditions  if you--,1,5,96
11,hizdahr zo loraq, the mission to yunkai was a resounding success the wise masters of yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders made up of both the freedmen and the former slaveholders all matters of consequence will be brought to you for review,1,5,44
12,jaime, what he built the towers he built it for us he meant it for us they’re going to try to take it away all of it  all of them out there are enemies they’re waiting a night to make sure he’s really dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes they’ll set to work on tearing us apart  this is exactly what they want,1,5,68
13,jon, get your shield up  if it wasn’t heavy it wouldn’t stop a sword now get it up  come try it again drive at me keep your shield up or i’ll ring your head like a bell  good good pivot don’t forget to pivot shield up  you’re not cold my lady  no  roose bolton  i want a great many things your grace but i’m a sworn brother of the night’s watch now  they’re good men  it’s where she belonged  they were born on the wrong side of the wall that doesn’t make them monsters  the men of the night’s watch are sworn to play no part--  your grace you want the wildlings to march in your army  i don’t think that’s likely  i respect him  your grace…  how much time do i have  here we are  this doesn’t have to be our last meeting  you know what stannis wants  shouldn’t a king be bold  you told me you weren’t here to conquer you told me your people have bled enough  you spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history thenns and hornfoots the ice-river clans even the giants a life’s work uniting them you didn’t do it for power you didn’t do it for glory you brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter not if they’re north of the wall isn’t their survival more important than your pride  then bend the knee and save your people  and how many tens of thousands are out there right now how many women how many children and you won’t go out and rescue them because why you’re afraid of looking afraid  they’ll burn you alive  and what happens to your people you preserve your dignity and die standing and they’ll sing songs about you “you’d rather burn than kneel the great hero” until winter comes and the white walkers come for us all and there’s no one left to sing  i think you’re making a terrible mistake,1,5,337
14,kevan, i apologize for my son’s appearance  they call themselves sparrows bloody fanatics religion has its place of course but at a certain point… they never would have come to the capital when tywin was alive  of course,1,5,37
15,lancel, your grace  my deepest sympathies  it wasn’t my wounds that needed healing  you can forgive me  i led you into the darkness  i tempted you into our unnatural relations and of course there was the king his boar hunt his wine  i’m a different person now i found peace in the light of the seven you can too they watch over all of us ready to dole out mercy… or justice their world is at hand i will pray for your father’s soul,1,5,83
16,little finger, lord arryn will never be a great warrior  some boys develop more slowly he’s still young  he has other gifts  the gift of a great name sometimes that’s all one needs  i have no doubt that upon my return robin’s skills will have improved immeasurably  i did  we are  lord royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is but he’s not alone in that castle do you trust all those knights and ladies stable boys and serving girls  no but i pay them well and they’ve seen what happens to men who disappoint me  so a land so far from here even cersei lannister can’t get her hands on you,1,5,112
17,loras, it was such a deep deep shock to us all your father was a force to be reckoned with he truly was i wouldn’t presume to claim to have known him as such…  but just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear just how formidable a person you were dealing with what a… what a force to be reckoned with  no it doesn’t  sandstone  fine  it’s dorne  judging by my experience that would be wonderful dorne highgarden anywhere but here  you’re very respectful  why they all know about me anyway everybody knows everything about everyone what’s the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this  my intended please tywin’s dead that means no one can force cersei to marry me  unlucky you  if she doesn’t marry me she doesn’t go to highgarden which means she stays in king’s landing which means you’re trapped here with cersei lannister as your mother-by-law  perhaps,1,5,159
18,maggy, get out get out  listen to your friend  you don’t know what i am  everybody wants to know their future until they know their future  your blood give me a taste  three questions you get you won’t like the answers  you’ll never wed the prince you’ll wed the king  oh yes you’ll be queen for a time in comes another younger more beautiful to cast you down and take all you hold dear  no the king will have 20 children and you will have 3  gold will be their crowns gold their shrouds,1,5,93
19,mance, so here we are  when we first met you were my prisoner and now for our last meeting…  no but it will be  oh aye i respect him if he gets what he wants i expect he’ll be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the iron throne the last hundred years but i’ll never serve him  that’s right but i don’t want them bleeding for stannis baratheon either  pride fuck my pride this isn’t about that  they followed me because they respected me because they believed in me the moment i kneel for a southern king that’s all gone  oh i am afraid no shame in that how will they do it beheading hanging  bad way to go i’ll be honest with you i don’t want to die and burnt to death i don’t want people to remember me like that scorched and screaming but it’s better than betraying everything i believe  you’re a good lad truly you are but if you can’t understand why i won’t enlist my people in a foreigner’s war there’s no point explaining  the freedom to make my own mistakes was all i ever wanted  this was my home for many years i wish you good fortune in the wars to come,1,5,209
20,margaery, we’re late for dinner as it is  i’m very hungry  what’s your name  i’m afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting olyvar  perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet  in any event…  you shouldn’t keep your intended waiting  lucky you  you think i want that woman married to my brother  perhaps  perhaps,1,5,55
21,melara, we shouldn’t be out here alone  if your father hears…  but if he finds out…  are you sure  we shouldn’t go in  let’s go…  come on we have to go we have to go cersei,1,5,35

23,missandei, torgo nudho  i wanted to speak with you  white rat the unsullied who… i have heard they found his body in a brothel i have heard that more than one unsullied has been known to visit meereen’s brothels may i ask you why why would an unsullied go to a brothel,1,5,51

33,sam, well i’m hardly a new recruit how many brothers can say they’ve killed a white walker and a thenn i might be the first in history  if ser alliser is chosen as the new lord commander… he hates the wildlings  all the wildlings  it’s not a sure thing ser denys mallister has commanded the shadow tower for 20 years and people say he’s a good man he’s running against ser alliser--  i told you wherever you go i go too,1,5,80
34,sansa, goodbye lord royce and thank you for all you’ve done for me  you told lord royce we were going to the fingers  but we’re heading west  if he wanted to betray us he already would have  no do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us  so where are we going to a land where you trust everyone,1,5,60

37,tyrion, i still don’t see why i had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail  do you know what it’s like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes  pentos  much better  i don’t think i am anymore a lord are you a lord if you kill your father i don’t suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore that has to be happen all the time  in a box why stop now  the future is shit just like the past  eunuch the spider the master of whisperers  not for a coward  you never told me why you set me free  you could have said no  not as dangerous as releasing me you risked your life your position everything why you’re not family you owe me nothing  a drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the seven kingdoms  you’re going to have to find another soldier i’m done with westeros and westeros is done with me  i’m not well-suited for work  compassion yes i killed my lover with my bare hands i shot my own father with a crossbow  what is it you want exactly  where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine the powerful have always preyed on the powerless that’s how they became powerful in the first place  i will never sit on the iron throne  good luck finding him  can i drink myself to death on the road to meereen,1,5,246
38,varys, apologies  i saved your life if they catch you they catch me i cannot say i feel overly guilty about leaving you in that “fucking crate”  no i only know what it’s like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard  the home of my colleague ilyrio mopatis a merchant he and i met many years ago through mutual friends a group of people who saw robert baratheon for the disaster he was we tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting the targaryen restoration and thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here things have gotten worse not better westeros needs to be saved from itself  my lord  you already drank yourself across the narrow sea  because we are talking about the future of our country  imp half-man  there are faster ways to kill yourself  you are many things my friend but not a coward  your brother asked me to  refuse the kingslayer a dangerous proposition  i didn’t do it for you i did it for the seven kingdoms  i don’t believe in saviors i believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come  you have many admirable qualities self-pity is not one of them any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power but earning it for yourself that takes work  i think you are you have your father’s instinct for politics and you have compassion  i never said you were perfect  peace prosperity a land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless  perhaps and perhaps we’ve grown so used to horror we assume there’s no other way if you sat on the iron throne would you spread misery throughout the land  no you won’t but you could help another climb those steps and take that seat the seven kingdoms need someone stronger than tommen but gentler than stannis a monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people a ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name  who said anything about him you have a choice my friend you can stay here at ilyrio’s palace and drink yourself to death or you can ride with me to mereen meet daenerys targaryen and decide if the world is worth fighting for,1,5,389

1,alli, crowded you'd think we were serving venison stew  i can't argue with any of that  but who does jon snow want to command night's watch or the wildlings everyone knows he loved a wildling girl and spoke with mance rayder many times what would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if stannis's army hadn't come along we all saw him put the king-beyond-the-wall out of his misery do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life or a man who makes love to them,2,5,94

14,daenerys, it would send a message  why  perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was  thank you all for your counsel  about what  the mad king you're here to remind me of my enemies' lies consider me reminded  go on  i'm not my father  i will not have the son of the harpy executed without a fair trial  why  he was our prisoner awaiting trial you had no right  there are no more slaves there are no more masters  the harpy's life was not yours to take once the masters were the law--  the law is the law take him  you opened your gates to me because i promised you freedom and justice one cannot exist without the other  a citizen of meereen was awaiting trial and this man murdered him the punishment is death  leave me  drogon,2,5,147

31,roose, we can't hold the north with terror alone  i sent you there to collect taxes not bodies  he left you no choice  and   i have something important to tell you stop eating and listen  we don't have enough men to hold the north if the other houses rise up against us do you understand that  i had a pact with tywin lannister and tywin lannister is dead the remaining lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact they've never once in the history of the seven kingdoms sent their army this far north if you think they will for us you're a fool we become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses and parleying those alliances into greater power the best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off the best way is marriage  now that you're a bolton by royal decree it's time you married a suitable bride and as it happens i found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the north  lady sansa welcome  may i introduce my son  ramsay bolton   and you're not anymore allow me a moment alone with lord baelish  shouldn't he be  i leave that to the brothel keeper it's her name i need not her virtue  and you prepared for the consequences when the lannisters hear i've wed sansa stark to ramsay  the queen will be enraged  and yet she still has friends men in important places whom she can ask for favours  a message for you from cersei lannister a rider arrived from eyrie shortly before dawn apparently she thinks you're still in the vale  i'm sure you understand my position lord baelish if you received word in the night from the queen mother it does make me question our new alliance the lannisters made you one of the great lords of westeros yet here you are in the north undermining them why gamble with your position  i had tywin lannister backing who supports me now you  i'd like to read the reply,3,5,343

33,sansa, that's moat cailin  on our way down to king's landing with my father and arya and… where are you taking me  the boltons have winterfell  the marriage proposal it wasn't for you  roose bolton murdered my brother he betrayed my family  he serves the lannisters  i won't go  not anymore  i can't marry him you can't make me he's a traitor a murderer  no  no you can't make me i will starve myself i will die before i have to go there   lord bolton  thank you,3,5,86
34,stannis, lord commander   i'd like to speak alone  very well  have you considered my offer  say the word and you will be  i'm giving you a chance to avenge your family to take back the castle where you grew up to rule the north  you're as stubborn as your father and as honorable  i didn't mean it as praise honor got your father killed  but if your mind’s made up i won't try to persuade you  are you bored of us already  i know it we march on winterfell within the fortnight before the snows trap us here  they'd rather burn than fight for me so be it i leave their fate to you you could execute them that's the safest course  or you could see if this tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than mance ever was i assume the brothers of the night's watch would rather see the wildlings dead  you're the lord commander your decision  you have many enemies in castle black have you considered sending alliser thorne elsewhere give him command of  eastwatch-by-the-sea  whoever said that didn't have many enemies,3,5,184

3,cersei, how much can the crown afford  you're the master of coin how do we pay them  you've already given us too much  no we must arrange better terms with the iron bank  in person  we must send an envoy to the iron bank someone of importance to show these bankers our respect as the king's master of coin i can think of no one more qualified  the king has expressed concern about his father-in-law's safety on this voyage  he's ordered ser meryn to personally lead your escort  safe travels lord tyrell   not small enough  may i offer you some wine your holiness  the old high septon would have asked the vintage   hmm  all over westeros we hear about septs being burned silent sisters raped bodies of holy men piled in the streets  perhaps the gods need a sword of their own  in the days before the targaryens the faith militant dispensed the justice of the seven  if i explain the holy purpose to my son the king i have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy  an army and service to the gods themselves and to you of course as the chosen representative of the seven  which is why you were chosen  you and i both know how the world works too often the wicked are the wealthiest beyond the reach of justice the king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most   what would you say if i told you we have a great sinner in our very midst shielded by gold and privilege   did i arrest him  i did and your wife has every right to criticize  can't allow fanatics to arrest the queen's brother no matter his perversions  i told you i am not holding ser loras you're the king i'm sure if you speak to the high sparrow he'll release the poor boy,4,5,314

8,high sparrow, no   i could say that our minds are temples to the seven and should be kept pure but the truth is  i don't like the taste   how may i serve  wars teach people to obey the sword not the gods  well the faith militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago  an army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people  an honor i never expected or indeed ever wished for  all sinners are equal before the gods  may the father judge him justly ,4,5,86
9,hizdahr, all men must die but not all can die in glory  why else do men fight why did your ancestors cross the narrow sea and conquer the seven kingdoms so their names would live on those who find victory in the fighting pits will never become kings but their names will live on it's the best chance they'll ever have  your grace today is the traditional start of the fighting season  traditions are the only thing that will hold this city your city together  without them former slaves and former masters have nothing in common nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment i can't promise this is the answer to all our problems but it's a start,4,5,117

4,daenerys," ""barristan the bold"" they called him he crossed a continent to serve me he was a loyal friend and he died in an alley butchered by cowards who hide behind masks  i prefer your earlier suggestion round up the leaders of each of meereen's great families and bring them to me   walk forward   another step   but a good mother never gives up on her children she disciplines them if she must   but she does not give up on them   i should let the dragons decide  don't want to overfeed them tomorrow perhaps  if i give everyone what they deserve i'll have no one left to rule ser barristan counseled mercy when i took this city right up to the morning he died daario naharis thinks i should kill the former masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself what do you think   you are as fit as anyone i know you know why i'm here and you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart so what do you think  what about ""valar morghulis""  it takes courage to admit fear and to admit a mistake i came here to tell you that i was wrong i was wrong and you were right about tradition about bringing the people of this city together i will reopen the fighting pits to free men only slavery will never return to meereen not while i live  and in order to forge a lasting bond with the meereenese people i will marry the leader of an ancient family  thankfully a suitor is already on his knees",5,5,267

31,tyrion, so those villages we were supposed to find we can’t live on berries and roots  you’re not hungry  you’re an awful travelling companion do you know that possibly the least charming man i have ever met  we are travelling together in each other’s company therefore…  i sailed from king’s landing to pentos in a crate without ever saying a word  never occurred to you to ask why until now you never wondered why tyrion lannister decided to visit a brothel in volantis  i killed my father he wanted to execute me for a crime i didn’t commit and he was fucking the woman i loved  as miserable as you are mormont at least your father was a good man  i met him i visited the wall when i asked him about his men he knew all the stories every one of them he actually cared about the people in his command how did they put it in the watch “we shall never see his like again”  you didn’t know i’m sorry i am  i only know what i heard  he was leading an expedition beyond the wall there was a mutiny he was murdered by his own men  why daenerys why is she worth all this as i recall the mormonts fought against the targaryens during robert’s rebellion  i believe in many things  no  no  doesn’t mean she’s going to be a great queen  the targaryens are famously insane what if she conquers the world then what 1000 years of peace and prosperity  we alright let’s assume your dreams come true she’s ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf she hacks off my head and restores your position you command her army sail to westeros defeat all your enemies then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the iron throne hurrah long live the queen then what  so a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in westeros becomes the ruler of westeros that’s justice  why because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king  why is it anchored  wait wait wait wait wait let’s discuss this  wait wait wait wait you can’t just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it he has to know it came from a dwarf and how could he know unless he sees the dwarf  guess again  the fighting puts in mereen you’re in luck then you’re about to be rich you are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms   him  sure he’s a bit long in the tooth a bit withered been in the sun too long we can all see that but he is a veteran of 100 battles they wrote songs about him  he won the tournament at lannisport unseating ser jaime lannister himself  the kingslayer,6,5,476

32,slave buyer,20,7,5,1
33,slave owner, many worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the great games when most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon it will represent a significant rise in your station but if you happen to triumph here you will fight at the great pit of daznak itself in front of the queen so whatever happens the gods have smiled upon you today today is the day your lives actually start to mean something,7,5,77
34,sparrow, you should have the decency to kneel before the gods  for me it’s the knees you  huh  the people always do the dirty work  a useful talent  your grandson and granddaughter swore sacred vows and lied the father judges us all sons of high lords sons of fishermen if you break his laws you will be punished  you don’t give commands here lady olenna  by the holy text the seven pointed star if you don’t have one in your library i’ll give you my own  then you’ll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws  yes the gods’ laws must be applied to all equally  have you ever served the field lady olenna have you ever reaped the grain has anyone in house tyrell a lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye you are the few we are the many and when the many stop fearing the few…  and  well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion a trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith  seven septons as it was in all trials before the targaryens  i will  then they will be at the mother’s mercy  it depends on the situation the acts themselves the degree of contrition  did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in king’s landing  baelor built his sept around it but men worshipped here long before him  who carved this altar do you know  no one does there’s no name on it or anywhere else in the chapel the people who built this place didn’t inflict their vanity on the people who came after them the way baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there their faith was clean  a young man came to us not long ago broken in body and spirit he had so much to strip away so much weighing him down but piece by piece he unburdened himself let go of vanity pride sin now his soul is so light he will float through the seven heaves like a bird  and he has much to say about you,7,5,386
35,squire, lady olenna,7,5,2
36,stannis, what else  500 men  sell swords loyal to nothing but gold  and  i retreated from king’s landing ser davos if i retreat again i become “the king who ran”  winter is coming those arent just the stark words it’s a fact if we march back to castle black we winter at castle black and who can say how many years this winter will last  this is the right time and i will risk everything because if i don't we’ve lost we march to victory or we march to defeat but we go forward only forward  i’ve trusted in your visions in your prophecies for years  i don’t know what i saw  and you do you trust yourself  are you sure  we don’t have robert’s bastard here  have you lost your mind  there must be another way leeches or something  she’s my daughter  get out,7,5,144

1,arya, my name is lana i’m an orphan when i was 8 i begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters and i sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more  iit took a while but i finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart now every morning i make my way down to the canals i pass the fish mongers and the bakers i usually see lhara my first customer of the day on my way home then i turn left onto moonsinger lane--  left onto ragman lane where i do most of my trade  how will she serve him  what will she do there  see what  oysters clams and cockles  oysters clams and cockles oysters clams and cockles  best in the city  so why would a captain make the wager in the first place  if the captain dies the thin man pays his family a lot of money  the many faced god you said you didn’t know what i would see at the docks  and then what,8,5,174

5,daenerys, you will not speak how do i know you are who you say you are  if you are tyrion lannister why shouldn’t i kill you to pay your family back for what it did to mine  so i should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family  if you’d rather return to the fighting pits just say the word  and why are you worth meeting why should i spend my time listening to you  i have a very large army and very large dragons  so you want to advise me very well  what would you have me do with him i swore i would kill him if he ever returned  why should the people trust a queen who can’t keep her promises  yes many opportunities  no not until forced to do so  so i should kill him  remove ser jorah from the city  so have you decided yet whether i’m worthy of your service  it’s probably my safest option  and what would your father do  is that why you killed him  i know what my father was what he did i know the mad king earned his name  i’m terrible  why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible  which kind is that  i did reopen the fighting pits under my rule murder will once again become entertainment  perhaps it won’t come to that  varys king robert’s spy master  jorah sent my secrets to varys for 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me  but you trust him  the brother who killed my father  perhaps i will have you killed after all  i’m not going to kill you  no  you’re going to advise me  while you can still speak in complete sentences  how to get what i want  if i want jokes i’ll get myself a proper fool  i fought so that no child born into slaver’s bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold i will continue that fight here and beyond but this is not my home  the common people  lannister targaryen baratheon stark tyrell they’re all just spokes on a wheel this one's on top then that ones on top and on and on it spins crushing the people on the ground  i’m not going to stop the wheel i’m going to break the wheel,8,5,398

10,jaqen, lana is very impressive very industrious she will make a fine servant for the many faced god  she will no longer turn left onto ragman lane she will turn right and go to ragman harbor  she will see  how can a man tell a girl this if he knew what she would see there would be no reason to send her  the man is a gambler he wages that his sailor's ship will make it to its destination it is a strange wager for the captain he only wins if he loses his life  a girl tells a man that she has seen  but perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesn’t have to pay after all a destitute woman and her small child what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself to whom can they turn for recourse  a man had no idea what she would see and what she would not a girl named lana will return to the docks she will watch the gambler she will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself  a gift for the thin man  perhaps she is perhaps she’s not  it is all the same to the many faced god,8,5,213

19,qyburn, the trial will take place the high sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you  fornication treason incest the murder of king robert  of course your grace my concern is that the faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown and i hope you’ll excuse me for saying it but belief is so often the death of reason  i’m afraid not your grace grand maester pycelle has summoned your uncle kevan back from casterly rock to serve as hand of the king he now presides over the small council  i implored him to visit you but he would not  your arrest and queen margaery’s arrest the king has not taken well he remains in his chambers his servants often find his food in the hall left untouched  i tried my grace he wouldn’t see me he wouldn’t see anyone  there is a way your grace a way out  goodbye my queen the work continues,8,5,160
20,ramsay, stannis isn’t from the north you are father i think you’re missing an opportunity to show the people of the north how house bolton treats southern invaders  that we not sit and wait to let stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be that we hit first and hit hard and leave a feast for the crows  i don’t need an army i need 20 good men,8,5,71
21,roose, and how high can stannis’ horses jump our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced we have enough food for six months we are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been all we have to do is wait for them to freeze starve and mutiny  you disagree  and what do you recommend  a smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage as long as we stay behind these walls they can’t touch us not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldn’t get an army through if we wanted to,8,5,100

29,tyrion, if only i were otherwise  you want revenge against the lannisters i killed my mother joanna lannister the day i was born i killed my father tywin lannister with a bow to the heart i am the greatest lannister killer of our time  into your service your grace we have only just met it’s too soon to know if you deserve my service  when i was a young man i heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory she had no wealth no lands no army only a name and a handful of supporters most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves they kept her alive moving her from place to place often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her she was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that and then a few years later the most well informed person i knew told me that this girl without wealth lands or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time along with three dragons he thought she was our best last chance to build a better world i thought you were worth meeting at the very least  because you can not build a better world on your own you have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule the strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you  killing and politics aren’t always the same thing when i served as hand of the king i did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people i could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name  i know  whomever ser jorah was when he started informing on you he is no longer that man i can’t remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you he claims he would kill for you and die for you and nothing i have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him and yet he did betray you  did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals  and did he  a ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion and you’re going to need to inspire devotion and lots of it if you’re ever going to rule across the narrow sea but you cannot have him by your side when you do  have you decided yet whether you’re going to have me killed  i can see why you would think so it’s what your father would have done  my father who publicly sentenced me to death i’d say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear  some day if you decide not to execute me i’ll tell you all about why i killed my father and on that day should it ever come we’ll need more wine than this  so here we sit two terrible children of two terrible fathers  i’ve heard stories  to see if you were the right kind of terrible  the kind that prevents your people from being even more so   yes that was wise and you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good very impressive my own sister married someone she loathed as well though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good gods forbid she ended up having him killed  it’s not impossible that varys was right about you after all  yes he was the one who convinced me to come find you he was my travelling companion before ser jorah seized that role for himself  he did what he had to do to survive he did a lot of other things that he didn’t have to do i suspect he’s the main reason you weren’t slaughtered in your crib  yes oddly he might be the only person in the world that i trust besides my brother  that’s the one  your queenly prerogative i had given up on life until varys convinced me you might be worth living for you chop off my head well my final days were interesting  no banish me  so if i’m not going to be murdered and i’m not going to be banished  advise you on what  the iron throne perhaps you should try wanting something else  i’m not entirely joking there’s more to the world than westeros after all how many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here perhaps this is where you belong where you can do the most good  and when you get back to your home who supports you  let’s be generous and assume that’s going to happen here in slaver’s bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people what was that like ruling without the rich house targaryen is gone not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you the starks are gone as well our two terrible fathers saw to that the remaining lannisters won’t back you not ever stannis baratheon won’t back you either his entire claim to the throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours that leaves the tyrells not impossible but not enough  it’s a beautiful dream stopping the wheel you’re not the first person to have dreamt it,8,5,909

8,daario, that one the smaller man no question that’s where you should put your money  people used to bet against me when i fought in the pits  he would have bet against me common novice mistake  whenever i got into the pit against a beast like that one the crowd saw me all skin and bone back then then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me they couldn’t get their money out fast enough but the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here  and the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren’t yes whenever i saw a beast like that one standing across from me making his beast faces i knew i could rest easy  shut your mouth  protect your queen  the other side follow me  protect your queen,9,5,143

10,davos, a band of 20 men maybe less they were in and out before anyone spotted them burnt our food stores to the ground all our siege weapons were destroyed dozens of tents were--  we’re still getting a count but hundreds are dead  the northerners know more about their land than we ever will  unless there’s a thaw we can’t press forward to winterfell and we don’t have enough food to get us back to castle black  forgive me your grace i never claimed to be an expert in military matters but if we can’t march forward and we won’t march back…  you sent for me your grace  your grace you’ve named me your hand  the king’s hand should never abandon the king especially in a time of war  a boy with a scroll could deliver this message  your grace perhaps queen and princess shireen could accompany me  at least let me take shireen a siege is no place for a little girl  what’s this one now  well that sounds like a proper story  but the dragon only saw a dumb man holding a mirrored shield  thus ending the dragonslaying career of ser byron swann i made you something princess  do you like it  you’re very welcome  of course i will  because you deserve it my son was always on me trying to teach me to read gods i was stubborn about it made it this far without reading seemed to me i could make it to the grave i wish i had listened to them this is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up  i’ll be gone for a few days princess i’ll want to hear all about the dance of dragons when i’m back,9,5,294
11,doran, forgive us we started without you please sit  and rather than send a raven or speak to me directly you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force  we can’t behead you many in dorne want war but i’ve seen war i’ve seen the bodies piled on the battlefields i’ve seen the orphans starving in the cities i don’t want to lead my people into that hell  and that is precisely what we are doing  let us drink to tommen the first of his name the king of the andals and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms  king tommen insists on his sister’s return to the capital  i cannot disobey my king’s command  she will return with you to king’s landing and my son prince trystane will accompany you both if the alliance between dorne and the iron throne is to continue their engagement must stand  one more thing my brother was named to the small council before his death your father understood the importance of keeping dorne in the loop with oberyn gone trystane will take his place on the small council  you are mother to four of my nieces girls i love very much for their sake i hope you live a long life talk to me that way again and you won’t  tell me ser jaime in king’s landing how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince  prince trystane must learn judgement if he’s to rule one day i’ll let him decide   i didn’t realize there were knights of the blackwater  perhaps some soup instead  your rebellion is over you can swear your allegiance to me now or you can die  i believe in second chances i don’t believe in third chances,9,5,294

9,cersei, myrcella…  do you remember the first time you saw a dead body  all i could think about when she died was what would happen to her now every day every night what does mama look like now has she started to bloat has her skin turned black have her lips peeled back from her teeth   i think about locking myrcella in a crypt  i think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse  i have to i have to it’s not right she has to suffer alone  she was good from her first breath she was so sweet i don’t know where she came from she was nothing like me no meanness no jealous just good  i thought if i could make something so good so puremaybe i’m not a monster  no i knew this would happen the witch told me years ago she promised me three children she promised me they’d die “and gold their shrouds” everything she said came true you couldn’t have stopped it it’s prophecy it’s fate  of course i do you told me yourself when father died you said we had to stay together you said people would try to tear us apart take what’s ours that was a prophecy too i didn’t listen to you and everything you said came true,1,6,217
10,daario, goat  you think our friend got him  we’re on the right path then  perhaps she’s tired of being queen i don’t think she likes it very much  maybe she’s flown somewhere else somewhere far away from men like us  there’s no escaping her eh you keep coming back why  isn’t it frustrating wanting someone who doesn’t want you back  you’re a romantic i admire that sometimes i look at you and i think “so that’s what i’ll be like when i grow old”  if i grow old i hope i do i want to see what the world looks like when she’s done conquering it  huh an army  dothraki,1,6,109
11,daenerys, do not touch me  i am daenerys stormborn of the house targaryen the first of her name the unburnt queen of meereen queen of the andals and the rhoynar of the first men khaleesi of the great grass sea breaker of chains and mother of dragons  i will not lie with you and i will bear no children for you or anyone else not until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east  i was wife of khal drogo son of khal bharbo  i know i burnt his body  if you will escort me back to meereen i will see that your khalasar is given a thousand horses as a sign of my gratitude,1,6,117

15,ellaria, and men  the gods are not fools you would have been a lousy adventurer and oberyn pfft he would have been a terrible ruler  when was the last time you left this palace you don’t know your own people their disgust for you elia martell raped and murdered and you did nothing oberyn martell butchered and you did nothing you’re not a dornishman you’re not our prince  your son is weak just like you and weak men will never rule dorne again,1,6,82

34,red priest, the lord of light sent the mother of dragons to you and those who love the darkness chased her away  how will you respond will you wring your hands while you wait for the mother of dragons to return or will you  you take up her flames yourselves will you fight for your own salvation now that queen daenerys is not here to fight for you,1,6,66
35,roose, your command of the cavalry was impressive thanks to you the false king stannis baratheon is dead do you know who struck the killing blow  a shame  i’d reward the man  still a great victory do you feel like a victor  i rebelled against the crown to arrange your marriage to sansa stark do you think that burning wagons in the night and mowing down tired outnumbered baratheons is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned lannister army  a reckoning will come we need the north to face it the entire north they won’t back us without sansa stark we no longer have sansa stark you played your games with her you played your games with the heir to the iron islands and now they’re both gone  i’m glad to hear it without sansa you won’t be able to produce an heir and without an heir well…  let’s hope the maesters are right and lady walder’s carrying a boy,1,6,160
36,sansa, i can’t  but it’s too cold i can’t i won’t make it i’ll die  no i won’t make it without you  and i vowthat you shall always have a place by my hearth and…  meat and mead at my table and i pledge to ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor i swear it by the old gods and the new arise,1,6,65
37,septa unella, “the seven hells brim with the souls of saintly men they scream in agony and their shame is so great they do not feel the flames for now they see if not for a single sin they concealed they were saved”  confess  confess  sinners don’t make commands they make confessions,1,6,50
38,theon, we can’t stop  we have to cross here  it’s the only way to throw off the hounds  i’ve seen what his hounds do to a person this way is better  over here come on  sansa sansa  stay here i’ll lure them away  you will go north only north jon is lord commander at castle black he’ll help you  dead  she broke her leg jumping from the ramparts i left her to die in the snow,1,6,75

40,tyrion, we’re never going to fix what’s wrong with this city from the top of an 800-foot pyramid  we’ll be fine we’re dressed like common merchants  you’ve spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk  it’s a good thing you’re not a boy anymorebecause you have no cock  for your baby to eat  i know what mhysa means  hard to know our queen is not as popular in meereen as she used to be  very possibly daenerys targaryen took away their most valuable property told them human beings weren’t even property to begin with you can see why they’re unhappy of course it could also be the freed men  many of the former slaves feel that daenerys has abandoned them  it’s a problem  fear has brought meereen to a standstill whoever you are wherever you go someone in this city wants to murder you we can’t fight an enemy we don’t know  and have you started looking for that someone  well we won’t be sailing to westeros anytime soon,1,6,171
41,varys, you walk like a rich person  you walk as though the paving stones were your personal property i used to steal from people like you when i was a boy  she thinks you want to eat her baby  his valyrian is terrible he only wants to give you money so your baby can eat  mhysa means mother in valyrian  who wrote it  the sons of the harpy  she did fly away on a dragon and not come back  the sons of the harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits very carefully which means they take orders from someone  my little birds have already taken wing soon they’ll return singing songs of men in gold masks,1,6,116

13,high sparrow, your grace lord commander  the gods wait for queen margaery to confess her crimes and seek their mercy the king must wait as well  on the contrary i fear a great deal the father the mother the warrior  do you know why we use these stones to remind us not to fear death we close our eyes on this world and open them on the next  in truth i fear that too  your sister sought the gods’ mercy and atoned for her sin  you would spill blood in this holy place  go on then i deserve it we all do we are weak vain creatures we live only by the mother’s mercy  i don’t they’d never reach me before you struck  no doubt many of us would fall but who are we hmm we have no names no family every one of us is poor and powerless and yet together we can overthrow an empire,2,6,155

31,tommen, she grew up  have we caught prince trystane’s killers i expect it was mother  yes she would  of course not  they told me she wouldn’t be allowed in the sept if she had tried --  don’t you think i know that i’m sorry but i can’t  when the faith militant seized her and margaery what did i do when they paraded her through the streets like a whore what did i do  the king is supposed to be the protector of the realm if i can’t even protect my own wife or my own mother what good am i  i want to see my wife  mother  gold  i know i should have come sooner i wanted to i was wrong  no it isn’t  i should have executed all of them i should have pulled down the sept onto the high sparrow’s head before i let them do that to you as you would have for me you raised me to be strongand i wasn’t but i want to be help me,2,6,171
32,tormund, until you  took a lot of knives i’ll have my men get the wood for a fire bodies to burn,2,6,20
33,tyrion, if i lost my cock i’d drink all the time  meaning no offense he makes dwarf jokes i make eunuch jokes  you think them  surely there’s some good news lurking somewhere  perhaps they can tell us their secret  what about the dragons we have two of them here beneath the pyramid  daenerys is the dragon queen can’t very well let the dragons starve that’s obvious  dragons do not do well in captivity  that’s what i do i drink and i know things  the dragons aegon used to conquer westeros ranged over hundreds of miles then daenerys’s ancestors started chaining them up in pens a few generations later the last dragons were no larger than cats they must be unchained or they’ll waste away missandei how many times were you in the company of these dragons  and did they ever harm you  dragons are intelligent more intelligent than men according to some maesters they have affection for their friends and fury for their enemies i am their friend  they will it’s time they had their supper  i’m friends with your mother i’m here to help don’t eat the help  when i was a child an uncle asked what gift i wanted for my name day i begged him for one of you “it wouldn’t even have to be a big dragon” i told him “it could be little like me”  everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard then my father told me the last dragon had died a century ago i cried myself to sleep that night  but here you are  next time i have an idea like that punch me in the face,2,6,278
34,varys, i do not make dwarf jokes  so the fleet it’s been burned  astapor and yunkai have stopped asking us for aid  the masters have retaken both cities outside of meereen the whole of slaver’s bay has returned to the slavers  do they know that,2,6,44

37,yara, the glovers have retaken deepwood motte  they died fighting to a man  what is dead may never die  but they did and our invasion died with them deepwood motte was our last stronghold on the mainland  why for more pinecones and rocks  we can defeat anyone at sea but we’ll never hold lands and castles against mainland armies  i won’t apologize for trying to rescue theon  where is your kingdom we took those castles because the northerners marched off to war that war is over the last time we provoked them too far i watched from that window as they breached our walls and knocked down our towers i lost two brothers that day  i’m going to find out who did this i’m going to feed them to the sharks while they live i swear it by the salt throne  my father would’ve wanted me to rule,2,6,147

7,daenerys, what are you doing take your hands off me i will have your heads  you have made a mistake one you will regret i am the wife of the great khal  because i am daenerys stormborn the breaker of chains the queen of meereen and the mother of dragons my place is not here with you  where else would i go every khaleesi becomes dosh khaleen,3,6,66
8,davos, easy easy easy  what do you remember  the lady brought you back  could you give us a moment  you were dead and now you’re not that’s completely fucking mad seems to me i can only imagine how it seems to you  i don’t know maybe we’ll never know what does it matter you go on you fight for as long as you can you clean up as much of the shit as you can  good now go fail again,3,6,79
9,dolorous edd, your eyes are still brown is that still you in there  that’s funny you sure that’s still you in there  it’s time  we should burn the bodies  what do you want me to do with this,3,6,36
10,dothraki matron, we know who you are i remember you eating the stallion’s heart why didn’t you come to us after khal drogo died  you were the wife of the great khal you thought he would conquer the world with you at his side he didn’t i was the wife of the great khal khal savo i thought he would conquer the world with me at his side you’re young we were all young once but we all understand the way things are you will learn as well if you are fortunate enough to stay with us  yes immediately after the death of their khal but you went out into the world that is forbidden all the khalasars have returned for the khalar vezhven they will decide which cities will be sacked and which tribes will be enslaved and now they must decide what to do with khal drogo’s silver-haired widow with luck your place will be here with us mother of dragons it is the best you can hope for now,3,6,170
11,dothraki woman, go,3,6,1
12,gilly, you all right  did i ever tell you i used to think the sea was called the see because it was nothing but water as far as the eye could see  sea see they’re spelled different but they sound the same  it was before i learned how to read obviously  sam are you going to be sick  won’t be long we’ll be in the south soon i’m excited to see oldtown captain says it’s the most beautiful city in westeros are you going to vomit again  i stayed at castle black there’s no women allowed there  i’ll stay in oldtown then  so if we’re not going to oldtown where are you taking me  “wherever you go i go too” that’s what you said  us and everyone else in the world  i know that sam and he does too you're the only one who ever has  if you think it’s for the best we trust you  i’d never do that to the father of my son,3,6,165
13,grey worm, patrol when i am going on patrol with the unsullied what we see on patrol who we captured on patrol  games are for children  we conquered asatapor and yunkai once we will do it again and execute the masters  if we do not fight them how can we stop them  so we will fight them,3,6,55
14,high sparrow, oh your grace  oh i'm sorry your grace that’s not possible not yet  when she's fully atoned for her sins  no she must stand trial before seven septons so we can learn the true extant of her sins  you are  it means a great deal to me the crown and the faith are the twin pillars of the world do you know who told me that your mother  how do you think the mother above first came to us how did men and women first come to feel the mother’s presence it was through their own mothers there is a great deal of falsehood in cersei you know that but when she speaks of you the mother’s love outshines it all her love for you is more real than anything else in this world because it doesn’t come from this world but you know that you’ve felt it you’ve seen her when she talks to you  it’s a great gift one i never had envy one more thing for me to atone for  you grace may i do you mind it's my knees  when your mother made her walk of atonement she did it to get back to you  it’s not what i want it’s what the gods want they make their will known to us and it’s up to us to either accept or reject it  please  if we’re to be just and good then we accept it all of us even kings a true leader avails himself of the wisest council he can and no one is wiser than the gods  the gods worked through him whether he knew it or not as they work through your mother there’s so much good in all of us the best we can do is to help each other bring it out,3,6,301
15,jaime, what did you do to him exactly i haven't been able to get a clear answer  does he understand what we’re saying i mean to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place  so tell him to march into the sept and crush the high sparrow’s head like a melon  has the faith leveled official charges yet  that is one trial by combat i look forward to watching  i’m lord commander of the kingsguard the lord commander of the kingsguard does have a position on the small council  the same women who murdered myrcella have overthrown house martell and taken control of dorne we've got a lot to discuss all of us together,3,6,117
16,jaqen, if a girl tells me her name i will give her eyes back  come  if a girl is truly no one she has nothing to fear  who are you,3,6,29
17,jon, they stabbed me ollyhe put a knife in my heart i shouldn’t be here  nothing there was nothing at all  i did what i thought was right and i got murdered for it and now i’m back why  i don’t know how to do that i thought i did buti failed  i’m not a god  i think so hold off on burning my body for now  if you have any last words now is the time  neither was killing me  i’m sure you would ser alliser  you should  wear it burn it whatever you want you have castle black  my watch is ended,3,6,103
18,kar, famously loyal to the starks  you think a horde of wildlings can take winterfell,3,6,14
19,kevan, can i help you  this is a small council meeting you have no position on the small council  no we cannot make you leave and you cannot make us stay not unless you're gonna have that thing murder us all,3,6,40
20,khal moro, welcome home khaleesi,3,6,3
21,lady olenna, i was invited my dear o help deal with several troublesome issues such as the queen’s imprisonment  margaery is the queen you are not the queen because you’re not married to the king i do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family,3,6,46
22,little bird, will lord varys ever come back  he was nice,3,6,9
23,mace, my mother,3,6,2
24,melisandre, afterwards after they stabbed you after you died where did you go what did you see  the lord let you come back for a reason stannis was not the prince who was promised but someone has to be,3,6,38
25,missandei, who said this  my master kraznys would sometimes make us play games  only the girls  we do not drink  you found out  we cannot the masters only speak one language they spoke it to me for many years i know it better than my mother tongue if we want them to hear us we must speak it back to them may it be the last thing they ever hear  possibly,3,6,70
26,ned, i looked for you on the trident  the mad king is dead rhaegar lies beneath the ground why weren’t you there to protect your prince  where’s my sister  no now it ends,3,6,32
27,othell yarwick, my mother's still living at white harbor could you write her tell her i died fighting the wildings,3,6,18
28,pycelle, as bad as lord varys was varys was qyburn is worse i told them all i told them he’s arrogant dangerous you don’t get thrown out of the citadel without good reason and no one listened to my advice so here we are  and what he's done to gregor clegane is an abomination we never sanctioned this this experiment and i for one think it would be in our best interest to have the beast dest --  well umi would say ser gerold hightower had a seat on the mad king’s council of course that was the mad king king robert saw things differently,3,6,104
29,qyburn, your eye looks much better arthur how’s your mother’s jaw  and your father  and no one will that worked out rather nicely  i don’t think so do you miss him  it’s funny you should mention that guess what i happened to find today candied plums from dorne  now remember if any of your friends like sweets or need help they can always come to me all i need in return are whispers  no need to be afraid this is ser gregor he’s friends with all my friends  run along now  your little birds now your grace  oh a number of things,3,6,101
30,qyburns, he understands well enough,3,6,4
31,ramsay, the umbers are a famously loyal house  when my father became warden of the north your house refused to pledge their banners  my beloved father the warden --  my father was poisoned by our enemies  why have you come to winterfell lord umber  so now you’ve come seeking help  pledge your banners to house bolton  swear loyalty to me as warden of the north and we will fight together to destroy the bastard and all his wildling friends  traditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord  why would i trust a man who won’t honor tradition  then it appears we're at a bit of an impasse  a girl i hope i prefer redheads  i like them wild  who’s this  how do i know that’s rickon stark  welcome home lord stark,3,6,129

2,cersei, what are you doing here  leave  is this a small council meeting  since i’ve missed the past several small coucil meetings i wanted to speak to you about a few things  as have we all unfortunately  look at me what did they do to me to the king’s own mother  it’s all right it's done it’s in the past and of course margaery’s safety is paramount  whether i like her or not is completely unimportant margaery is the queen queens must command respect kings even more so not just for their own sake but for everyone’s the high sparrow has no respect for kings or queens no respect for anything in this world he has no use for the things of this world he want to knock them down and replace them with what with fantasies with beggars in the street with nothing  you’ve spoken with him  it would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly given his constant prattling about the truth i am your mother you can always trust me  the small council meeting has been postponed on the king’s orders  you once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one’s rivals  the high sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back here we are well done to us now the future of the seven kingdoms rest in his dirty peasant hands in a few days he’ll have a trial for me but before that queen margaery will make her walk of atonement yes margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city  i agree  you hate these fanatics as much as we do you hate what they’ve done to your son  do you want lancel back or have you given him up for good  then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed,4,6,323
3,daario, you all right why don’t you sit and catch your breath  i don’t think you could ride the dragon 20 years ago maybe  our queen she’s wild you know don’t let her size fool you it’s hard enough for me and i’m a young man you i don’t think your heart could take it  must make you angry that our queen chose me  we’ll all disappoint her before long  oh i don’t want to fight you jorah the andal what do i have to gain if i win i’m the shit who killed an old man if i lose i’m the shit who was killed by an old man  none  what are you doing  isn’t it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi  you’re asking a dog to hand over his teeth  i’m very attached to this knife  you know what happens  i’ll do it myself  i should have been born a dothraki  told you i’m very attached to this knife  you all right  huh  she’ll give us away,4,6,172
4,daenerys, that is more than most have  i need to make water  i will never run from dothraki  i needed fresh air the old women stink  you must have been very young when your khal died  too bad he didn’t die sooner  mm-hmm  they do would you like to see them one day  no don’t hurt her  we will never get out of vaes dothrak alive  no we can do more than that and you’re going to help me  and youhave faith in me khaleesi do not betray me  don’t you want to know what i think  no i don’t want either of those things  i know where i am i have been here before this is where the dosh khaleen pronounced my child the stallion who mounts the world  this is where drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends to ride wooden horses across the black salt sea as no khal has done before he promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses he swore to me before the mother of mountains  and here now what great matters do the great khals discuss which little villages you’ll raid how many girls you’ll get to fuck how many horses you’ll demand in tribute you are small men none of you are fit to lead the dothraki but i am so i will  you’re not going to serve you’re going to die,4,6,242

10,high sparrow, if i were to let you leave right now where would you go what would you seek out  of course but for you that means seeking out money finery power seeking out your family means seeking out sin i’m not maligning you i sought those things out too to the exclusion of all else my father was a cobbler he died with i was young and i took over his shop he was a simple man and he made simple shoes but i found that the more work i put into my shoes the more people wanted them fine leather ornamentation detailing and time time most of all dozens of hours spent on a single pair  yes i imagine you’ve worn a year of someone’s life on your back the highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege i used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself each time i indulged i felt myself ascending to something better  you know the seven-pointed star  yes yes she does enjoy reading at people you’re close but it wasn’t a graveyard it was a feast i bought old fine wine and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come share it all we passed around the wine passed around the women and soon we fell into a stupor i woke before dawn i could barely stand everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor lying in heaps next to their fine clothes the truth of their bodies laid bare i could smell them beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn and i saw it with perfect clarity i saw what my sins were the gold i had the wine i drank the women i used my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position it was all part of a story a story i was telling myself about who i was a collection of lies that would disappear in the light the people i was trying to climb away from the beggars in the street the poor they were closer to the truth than i ever was  i left to go and find them i didn’t even put on my shoes i walked out the door and never went back  come let’s go and see him  your brother,4,6,398
11,jaime, cersei is the mother of the king she has the king’s ear and his trust and the king has been speaking regularly with the high sparrow about queen margaery and ser loras  you’ve got the second largest army in westeros you'll bring them into the city stop queen margaery’s humiliation before it starts and take her back into crown custody   you’ll take no action at all when the tyrell armies come you will stand down are you expressly forbidden from standing down   the whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything when the high sparrow is in custody or dead preferably and margaery's back at tommen’s side do you think the king will be angry at the outcome,4,6,124
12,jon," south  get warm  i did everything i could you know that  aye i pledged my life to the night’s watch i gave my life  they killed me edd my own brothers you want me to stay here after that  with the peas and onions  we never should have left winterfell  how could we know  we were children  you were occasionally awful i’m sure i can’t have been great fun always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played  there’s nothing to forgive  all right all right i forgive you  you’d think after thousands of years the night’s watch would have learned how to make a good ale  where will we go if i don’t watch over you father’s ghost will come back and murder me  i can’t stay here not after what happened  should we tell the boltons to pack up and leave  i don’t have an army  they didn’t come here to serve me  sansa  i’m tired of fighting  it’s all i’ve done since i left home i’ve killed brothers of the night’s watch i’ve killed wildlings i’ve killed men that i admire i hanged a boy younger than bran i fought and i lost  i’m not lord commander anymore  ""to the traitor and bastard jon snow you allowed thousands of wildlings past the wall you have betrayed your own kind you have betrayed the north winterfell is mine bastard come and see your brother rickon is in my dungeon  his direwolf's skin is on my floor come and see i want my bride back send her to me bastard and i will not trouble you or your wildling lovers keep her from me and i will ride north and slaughter every wildling man woman and babe living under your protection you will watch as i skin them living you --  it's just more of the same  lord of winterfell and warden of the north  we don’t know that  how many do you have",4,6,327
13,jorah, i’m fine  what  makes me sad you’ll disappoint her before long she’ll move on  we need each other right now after we’re done needing each other --  you didn’t get much discipline as a child did you  the road running through the horse gate they call that the godsway  eastern market western market when khal drogo died she was supposed to come here and join the dosh khaleen the widows of the dead khals that’s where they would have taken her the temple of the dosh khaleen  it’s forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city  if they spot us and we’re unarmed we’ll say we’re traders heading for the western market but if they see weapons…  there’s 100000 of them down there we can’t fight our way out we wait till dark and then we’ll find her  don’t worry it didn’t touch you  i know what happens  come on  my friendswe wandered off from the western market and got lost could you show us the way back  wine come down to my stall tomorrow i’ll give you a cask of the arbor’s finest  if they find a body with a stab wound the whole city will be looking for us  we have to go now  all we can do is try,4,6,212
14,kevan,  the king has ordered me to take no action against the high sparrow or the faith militant out of fear for the queen’s safety  no but if the king should call on me --  of course i want him back  if it doesn’t go as planned the sparrows have many friends in the city we’ll have civil war many will die,4,6,61

20,lady olenna, i would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time you’re not welcome  my dear you have been stripped of your dignity and authority publicly shamed and confined to the red keep what’s left to work with  oh no that cannot happen that will not happen  many will die no matter what we do better them than us,4,6,59
21,leader, some of them don’t think dothraki should breed with foreigners they are stupid old women they don’t realize that we have always diluted our blood this one is lhazareen her khal found her hiding in a well after he burned her village how old were you  a year later she bore her khal a daughter how did he show his happiness  we are not queens here but the khals depend on us for our wisdom our lives have meaning  when the khals meet for the khalar vezhven tomorrow night i hope they let you live out your days with us the other possibilities are not so pleasant  you can’t run from dothraki you know this  go show her,4,6,118

24,loras, i can’t stay strong i never was strong  i don’t care about that  i just want it to stop help me  let them win just make it stop please,4,6,29
25,man, riders approaching  open the gate  a letter for you lord commander,4,6,11
26,man #1, we speak the common tongue  our brothers and sister died fighting these scum now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them  you are a stranger here so why do you represent meereen in these talks with our enemies  we don’t know you we don’t trust you we know torgo nudho we fight with him against the masters we trust him  and you grey worm you want to drink wine with these men the men who tore us from our mothers’ arms and sold us at auction like cattle,4,6,92
27,man #2, open the gate  you met with the slavers today  when does she return  you have made peace with the slavers  missandei you know what these men are how can you trust them,4,6,32
28,margaery, i’d go to my brother my husband my family  quality takes time  and one day you walked through a graveyard and realized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness book of the stranger verse 25  septa unella reads it to me at me  so what did you do  who  loras loras  listen to me you need to stay strong  you are strong you are the future of our house the future of our family  they want me to help you they want me told help tear you down that’s why he’s letting me see you i know it is and if either of us give in to what they want then they win  all right,4,6,121
29,melisandre, ser davos  i will do as jon snow commands  he’s the prince that was promised  there was a battle stannis was defeated,4,6,22
30,missandei, our queen tried to make peace with the masters and they tried to murder her  how many days were you a slave  not long enough to understand  she refused them because hundreds of thousands of men women and children still lived in chains  perhaps i should translate for you  i do not trust them i will never trust them  but as a wise man once said “we make peace with our enemies not our friends”  you promised the slavers they could keep slavery  seven years is not a short time for a slave,4,6,93
31,osha, a lord  the flayed man  you eat them after  then i’ve seen worse  aye they put me in chains and put a sword at my throat so i’ve served them   he'd fetch a good price to the right buyer i served his family a long time didn’t get no wages way i see it i’m owed  i can give you what you want  same thing men always want and when they really want it they give it a bath first  that so,4,6,82
32,pycell, i am a member of the small council the king’s small --  obviously not i’m here to lend my wisdom and my support  your grace,4,6,25
33,pycelle, and now how to avert disaster with our current predicament this high sparrow i have dealt with fanatics of every description your grace not setting them off that’s the most important thing you are beset with enemies both within and without  i am advising the king on our current predicament,4,6,50
34,ramsay, they've cleaned you up nicely you know who i am  yes a lord you’ve seen my banners  does that worry you at all  no  you served the starks  the starks have been gone for a long time but you kept protecting rickon  be that as it may rickon's not yours to sell anymore he’s mine so what use could i possibly have for you  are you sure you know what that is  you’re a good talker  i like that  you’re a much better talker than theon greyjoy  i had to work hard to get him talking but he talked they all do  he told me everything all about the stark boys who helped them escape and how she did it,4,6,120
35,razdal, we came here to meet the queen and instead we’re greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch  when we last met i offered her ships so she could return to westeros where she belongs she refused them  as they have since the dawn of time,4,6,45
36,robin, uncle petyr  a falcon  shall we throw him through the moon door  do you believe him uncle petyr  fine  she’s my cousin we should help her,4,6,26
37,sansa," this is good soup do you remember those kidney pies old nan used to make  mmm  don’t you wish we could go back to the day we left i want to scream at myself “don’t go you idiot”  i spent a lot of time thinking about what as ass i was to you i wish i could change everything  i was awful just admit it  can you forgive me  forgive me  where will you go  where will we go  there’s only one place we can go home  we’ll take it back from them  how many wildlings did you save  they owe you their lives  you think they’ll be safe here if roose bolton remains warden of the north  winterfell is our home it’s ours and arya’s and bran’s and rickon’s wherever they are it belongs to our family we have to fight for it  if we don’t take back the north we’ll never be safe i want you to help me but i’ll do it myself if i have to  that’s all right there are more important things  go on  ""you will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sister you will watch as my dogs your wild little brother then i will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest come and see ramsay bolton lord of winterfell and warden of the north  his father's dead ramsay killed him and now he has rickon  yes we do  i heard him say 5000 once when he was talking about stannis’s attack  you're the son of the last true warden of the north northern families are loyal they’ll fight for you if you ask  a monster has taken our home and our brother we have to go back to winterfell and save them both",4,6,299
38,theon, i escaped  i escaped  i’m sorry  i know i know and i’m sorry  he broke me he broke me into a thousand pieces  you don’t know  where else could i go  no no i only heard he died after we docked  i didn’t know  i don’t want to be king  i should’ve listened to you you’re the only one --  you should rule the iron islands let me help you,4,6,70
39,tommen, thank you for your counsel grand maester that will be all for now  i’ve been thinking about the high sparrow  we need to be careful in dealing with such a man to prevent things from escalating any further we have to be careful not to antagonize him he has margaery we can’t put her at risk he’s dangerous  you don’t like margaery do you  motherthere’s something i want to tell you something the high sparrow told me  i promised him i wouldn’t tell anyone if he found out i told --,4,6,91
40,tormund, how many men does he have in his army  that can march and fight 2000 the rest are children and old people,4,6,22
41,tyrion, i did as a clever man once told me “we make peace with our enemies not our friends”  yes that’s the military approach and how has that worked here in meereen i represent the diplomatic approach  long enough to know  and now you speak for the good masters of astaporhere’s to reversals of fortune  let’s make this simple shall we tell me what you want  queen daenerys won’t stay in meereen forever her path takes her westward  friends friends friends please  there have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing that is the way of the world i’m not here to change the way of the world  you don’t need slaves to make money there haven’t been slaves in westeros for hundreds of years and i grew up richer than any of you but our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it so here is the queen’s proposal slavery will never return to meereen but she will give the other cities of slaver’s bay time to adjust to the new order  instead of abolishing slavery overnight we will give you seven years to end the practice  slaveholders will be compensated for their losses of course at fair prices in exchange you will cut off your support for the sons of the harpy  fine fine but you will cut it off all the same i do hope you accept my friends you will not receive a better offer  let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it and as a parting gift to our honored guests…  give freedom a chance see if it doesn’t taste every bit as good as what came before  my friends large sorryyou wait so fat time  excellent  i did  i imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled  but i am not your ruler i’m not the breaker of chains i’m not the unburnt and i am certainly not the mother of dragons  because our queen chose me as her advisor until she returns from her travels --  soon you have my word  and that is exactly why grey worm took part in these negotiations as commander of the unsullied he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace  we offered terms  those men respect you  as do i  i am not betraying her work i am trying to save her city  for a short time  you’re right slavery is a horror that should be ended at once war is a horror that should be ended at once i can’t do both today  i don’t trust the masters i trust their self-interest they’re trustworthy if they’re convinced that working with me is in their self-interest  they look at me and they see a misshapen little beast their contempt is their weakness they’ll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage,4,6,498
42,yara," they told me you were home and i didn’t believe it “theon greyjoy” i said “he’s dead he’s been dead a long time"" he let you go  i can’t hear you  look at me look at me men died trying to rescue you good men my men  you were my brother you’re a spoiled little cunt but you were my brother and i risked everything for you and you betrayed me  stop saying that  i know  he send us one of those pieces that’s why i came for you  why did you come here  you heard father was dead and thought you’d claim the crown  you happen to show up on pyke right before the kingsmoot  you think any ironborn wants you to be king after what you’ve done  what do you want  that doesn’t matter anymore stop crying  look at me tell me what you want",4,6,147
43,yezzan, i bought this dwarf for a single gold honor and somehow you’ve risen to the top of the great pyramid of meereen it’s most impressive  you think you’re a free man now you still follow orders just because your master has silver hair and tits doesn’t mean she’s not a master  slavery is the way of our world  what does that mean  we do not support the sons of the harpy,4,6,71
44,yohn royce, last time i saw you baelish you told me you were taking sansa stark home with you to the fingers  and yet not long ago we received reports that she has been married to ramsay bolton in winterfell  do you take me for a fool  slander a man in his own home you might find yourself crossing swords with him  my lord my lord i have always been faithful to house arryn to your father to your mother and now to you  you can trust my absolute loyalty my lord,4,6,90

3,arya, who was the first  where did they go  a girl has no desires  who  a girl will poison the rum lady crane is the only one who drinks it  if a girl could use one of the faces from the hall…  she’s a good actress  seems like a decent woman  no who wants her dead  the younger actress she’s jealous because lady crane is better  a girl has decided,5,6,69
4,bianca, save my father  save him please  father no oh father  i had two lines  i rang very false  you weren’t complaining about me last night,5,6,25

6,bran, it was you you made the white walkers  from whom  what  he saw me the night king he saw me  i don’t know he was close but --  but he can’t get in  i’m sorry i didn’t mean to  the time for what  but am i ready,5,6,47
7,brienne, lady sansa asked you a question  i’ve sworn to protect you my lady  we can send the blackfish a raven  i don’t like leaving you here alone  not him he seems trustworthy a bit brooding perhaps i suppose that’s understandable considering the others though davos and the red woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic and when stannis paid for his crime where were they already out looking for a leader with better prospects and that wildling fellow with the beard --  then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about riverrun,5,6,102
8,camello, ooh ooh what’s happened here then  we men of the north are right good hands at keeping people lawful  i’d ask him for permission but he smells too bloody awful  the iron throne’s what i demand  i can  i will  i dare yes  what’s that mean  what’s that mean  what’s that mean  so move along give me my chair and there won’t be no more trouble  but we had a deal all done and dusted  i’m starting to think you can’t be trusted  well don’t worry love they usually go away in five or six years  oh wash this darling it stinks of me,5,6,104
9,clarenzo, oh come father in bed you must lie i love you father please don’t die  good people you may all relax my father’s friend shall be spared the —  it’s a wart two warts i’ve got two fucking warts on my cock,5,6,42
10,daenerys, i banished you twice you came back twice and you saved my life so i can’t take you back and i can’t send you away  is there a cure  how long does it take  i’m sorry i’m so sorry  do not walk away from your queen jorah the andal  you have not been dismissed you pledged yourself to me you swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life  well i command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world i command you to heal yourself and then return to me when i take the seven kingdoms i need you by my side,5,6,108
11,davos, aside from the starks and the boltons the most powerful houses in the north are the umbers the karstarks and the manderlys  the umbers and the karstarks have already declared for the boltons so we’re not doing so well there  i beg your pardon my lady but they know that a stark beheaded their father i don’t think we can count on them either  precious little my lady  they may well be loyal but how many rose up against the boltons when they betrayed your family i may not know the north but i know men they’re more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don’t want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause if jon’s going to convince them to fight alongside him they need to believe it’s a fight they can win  i don’t doubt it but jon doesn’t have the stark name  i didn’t know the tullys still had an army  that’s good the blackfish is a legend his support would mean a great deal stark tully a few more houses almost starts to look like a winning side,5,6,195
12,dolorous edd, i’ll do my best  good luck  i’m not the lord comman --  yeah ahem close the bloody gate,5,6,18

17,jaqen, she has a point  none of the first faceless men were born to lords and ladies they began as slaves in the mines of valyria  he was no one the many-faced god taught him how to shed his face and how to give the gift the man taught others in exchange for their service many served many more gifts were given soon all the masters and overseers were gone and the faceless men fled  here they founded the free city of braavos and built this house these were the faces they wore in life when they were not wearing others the first faceless men and now a girl is one of them if a girl desires  an actress who calls herself lady crane she performs at the theater in sheelba square a girl has been given a second chance there will not be a third one way or another a face will be added to the hall  a girl is not ready  so a man has heard  does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind  that does not matter the price was paid  a girl must decide if she wants to serve the many-faced god  a servant does not ask questions,5,6,205
18,jon, we can’t defend the north from the walkers and the south from the boltons if we want to survive we need winterfell and to take winterfell we need more men  how do you know that  new dress  thank you sansa  don’t knock it down while i’m gone,5,6,47

20,kinvara, you don’t need to persuade me i came to help  daenerys stormborn is the one who was promised from the fire she was reborn to remake the world  she has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the masters for their sins  her dragons are fire made flesh a gift from the lord of light but you heard all this before haven’t you on the long bridge of volantis the dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands burning their sins and flesh away  you want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed and while she’s gone you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed  i will summon my most eloquent priests they will spread the word daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come  everything is the lord’s will but men and women make mistakes even honest servants of the lord  everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason terrible things happen for a reason take what happened to you lord varys when you were a child if not for your mutilation at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer you wouldn’t be here helping the lord’s chosen bring his light into the world knowledge has made you powerful but there’s still so much you don’t know do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire you heard a voice call out from the flames do you remember should i tell you what the voice said  should i tell you the name of the one who spoke  we serve the same queen if you are her true friend you have nothing to fear from me,5,6,292

32,sansa, yes  how far is mole’s town  unharmed what are you doing here  to come to my aid did you know about ramsay if you didn’t know you’re an idiot if you did know you’re my enemy  would you like to hear about our wedding night he never hurt my face he needed my face the face of ned stark’s daughter but the rest of me he did what he liked with the rest of me as long as i could still give him an heir what do you think he did  what do you think he did to me  yes he enjoyed that what else do you think he did  what else  maybe you did know about ramsay all along  i thought you knew everyone’s secrets  the other things he did ladies aren’t supposed to talk about those things but i imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time i can still feel it i don’t mean in my tender heart it still pains me so i can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now  you said you would protect me  i don’t believe you anymore i don’t need you anymore you can’t protect me you won’t even be able to protect yourself if i tell brienne to cut you down and why shouldn’t i  what if i want you to die here and now  you freed me from the monsters who murdered my family and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family go back to moat cailin my brother and i will take back the north on our own i never want to see you again  i have an army  the umbers gave rickon to our enemies they can hang but the karstarks declared for ramsay without knowing they had another choice  how well do you know the north ser davos  my father always said northerners are different more loyal more suspicious of outsiders  the north remembers they remember the stark name people will still risk everything for it from white harbor to ramsay’s own door  no but i do  jon is every bit as much ned stark’s son as ramsay is roose bolton’s ant there are also the tullys they’re not northern but they will back us against the boltons without question  my uncle the blackfish has reformed it and retaken riverrun  ramsay received a raven before i escaped winterfell  you heard them we need more men and my uncle has an army  can’t risk ramsay intercepting it it has to be you  ride for riverrun my uncle will talk to you and you’ll know how to talk to him  what is it  with jon  jon isn’t tormund jon isn’t davos the red woman or stannis for that matter jon is jon he’s my brother he’ll keep me safe i trust him  i made it myself do you like it  good because i made this for you  i made it like the one father used to wear as near as i can remember  you’re welcome,5,6,506
33,theon, i am theon greyjoylast living son of balon greyjoy  and she is your rightful ruler those of you that have sailed under her and there are many of you here you know what she is  she is a reaver  she is a warrior  she is ironborn  we will find no better leader this is our queen  that would have been hard to do you weren’t here last i heard you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time  you were gone yara was here being ironborn leading ironborn getting ready to bring us back to glory,5,6,98

35,tyrion, it’s not enough  it’s not enough for meereen to have peace they need to know daenerys is responsible for it the sons of the harpy have a good story resist the foreign invaders our queen has an even better story mother of dragons breaker of chains andall that  yes but do they know who brought them security who brought about an end to the violence we need someone the people trust someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced  who said anything about “him”  welcome to meereen  that’s about the extent of my valyrian  thank you for travelling all this way i know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be  the truth is we need your help we had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to --  yes  she did indeed  ideally we’d avoid purifying too many nonbelievers the mother of dragons has followers of many different faiths  i’d settle for obeyed  that sounds most excellent --  we’d be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen  my friend has a healthy skepticism of religion but we are all loyal supporters of the queen,5,6,190
36,varys, in the last fortnight since our pact with the masters how many killings have been carried out by the sons of the harpy  and how many masters have been butchered by the free men  so it’s safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold  for now is the best we get in our profession  considering the city was on the brink of civil war i’d say it’s a good start  sounds like quite the hero where would we find him  a man named stannis baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses he too had a glorious destiny he attacked king’s landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me last i had heard he’d been defeated again this time at winterfell and this time for good  i suppose it’s hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake isn’t that the whole point of being a fanatic you’re always right everything is the lord’s will  and you an honest servant of the lord why should i trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled stannis,5,6,186
37,waif, you’re not ready you should go home before it’s too late  you’ll never be one of us lady stark,5,6,19
38,yara, i am yara greyjoy daughter of balon greyjoy king of the iron islands i claim the salt throne  there are many things we’ve never done we’ve never made our mark upon the world the great lords of westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance then they swat us down they conquer us humiliate us and go right back to forgetting we exist  we are a sea people  our god is a sea god  when i am queen we will build a fleet that —  i am not finished  when did you return uncle  i’m glad you’re here now i know what my first act as queen will be to execute the man who killed my father  i will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen  you’re going to seduce the dragon queen,5,6,146

15,high sparrow, you’re afraid for her  she’ll be protected the entire way the faith militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds and queen margaery isn’t your mother i suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf she’s truly opened her heart to them  and now she’s devoted to the gods as well would you like to see her  rich or poor noble or common if we win we must atone margaery of house tyrell came to us a sinner she stood before the gods in the holy sept and lied she turned a blind eye to her brother’s sins she disgraces her house the king and herself  lord tyrell  ser jaime  i don’t have the authority to give them to you and you don’t have the authority to take them  the gods don’t recognize his authority in this matter  to die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us we yearn for it but there is no call for it today there will be no walk of atonement  queen margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the true light of the seven  together we announce a new age of harmony a holy alliance between the crown and the faith,6,6,215

31,waif, as i expected  you promised me,6,6,6
32,walder, you’ve lost it  it’s a castle not a bloody sheep presumably you still know where it is you didn’t lose riverrun you let the blackfish take it from you  you did lose the blackfish after the red wedding you had him right here in this hall and you let him leave then when i told you to hunt him down and kill him you couldn’t find him that’s what it means to lose something now he’s come back and taken riverrun  for 300 years we kissed tully boots swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners not again riverrun is ours take it back  we’ve got 10 times as many men as the damn blackfish  if i want excuses i’ll put her in charge they’re laughing at us all across the riverlands right down to king’s landing they’re laughing at us  i hear it in my sleep i’m not dead yet unfortunately for you and i’ll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter take that castle back  oh he’ll yield  you’ll show him the knife you used to kill robb stark’s child in his whore mother’s belly and you’ll show him the knife you used to open his niece’s throat and you’ll remind him who it was that got married at the red wedding in the first place his nephew  cheer up lord edmure you’re going home,6,6,232

2,bronn, now that is a sorry attempt at a siege someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches  oh no not me i’m just an upjumped sellsword  aye knights don’t get paid  that’s like saying i have a bigger cock than anyone in the unsullied army  you promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife  don’t say it don’t fucking say it  good thing we’re friends or we’d be fucking you in the ass right now  have your lads start digging perimeter trenches set pickets every hundred yards and work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets  a parley or a fight  you’ve got one hand my money’s on the old boy,7,6,120
3,brynden, go on then cut his throat  kingslayer  i assume you’re here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece i don’t see sansa and arya  pity do you wish to resume your captivity  then why are you here  or you’ll kill edmure  my nephew’s marked for death no matter what hang him and be done with it  hundreds of mine thousands of yours if you can breach the walls  your honor bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand  as long as i’m standing the war is not over this is my home i was born in this castle and i’m ready to die in it so you can either attack or try to starve us out we have enough provisions for two years do you have two years kingslayer  sieges are dull and i wanted to see you in person get the measure of you  aye now i have i’m disappointed,7,6,152
4,cersei, i heard you were leaving king’s landing  your grandson is still a prisoner you’ll leave him rotting in a cell  you’re right i made a terrible mistake i carry it with me every single day  i delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep and now we must fight them together we need each other  you love your granddaughter i love my son it’s the only truth i know we must defend them  never i’ll never leave my son,7,6,79
5,davos, if it please my lady i understand how you feel  davos my lady of house seaworth  you needn’t ask your maester about my house it’s rather new  you never thought you’d find yourself in your position being responsible for so many lives at such a young age i never thought i’d be in my position i was a crabber’s son then i was a smuggler and now i found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war but i’m here because this isn’t someone else’s war it’s our war  your uncle lord commander mormont made that man his steward he chose jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right even if it meant giving his life because jeor mormont and jon snow both understood that the real war isn’t between a few squabbling houses it’s between the living and the dead and make no mistake my lady the dead are coming  as long as the boltons hold winterfell the north is divided and a divided north won’t stand a chance against the night king you want to protect your people my lady i understand but there’s no hiding from this we have to fight and we need to do it together  if they’re half as ferocious as their lady the boltons are doomed  stannis camped here on his way to winterfell  he was the most experienced commander in westeros he chose this place for a reason those mountains are a natural fortification there’s a stream down there for the horses  aye the snows defeated stannis as much as the boltons did  it’s not what we’d hoped for but we still have a chance if we’re careful and smart  for fuck’s sake  friends this is not worth fighting over  this’ll be it now right now we don’t need to be fighting  hold on,7,6,314
6,dim dalba, we said we’d fight with you king crow when the time comes and we meant it but this isn’t what we agreed to these aren’t white walkers this isn’t an army of the dead this isn’t our find  remember mance’s camp it stretched all the way to the horizon and look at us now look what’s left of us and if we lose this we’re gone dozens of tribes hundreds of generations be like we were never there at all we’ll be the last of the free folk,7,6,88
7,high sparrow, your grace what are we reading today  you learn quickly there are some who know every verse of the sacred text but don’t have a drop of the mother’s mercy in their blood and savages who can’t read at all who understand the father’s wisdom  they are hard to love  the poor disgust us because they are us shorn of our illusions they show us what we’d look like without our fine clothes how’d we smell without perfume  can i ask you about a personal matter  the king mentioned that since your reunion you haven’t joined him in the marriage bed  you have a duty your grace to your husband your king your country to the gods themselves  congress does not require desire on the woman’s part only patience the king must have an heir if we are to continue our good work  hard to find and harder still to walk upon but you’ve made great progress i only pray your grandmother follows your lead  yes the queen of thorns is a remarkable woman a strong woman and an unrepentant sinner you must teach her the new way as she taught you the old or i fear for her safety body and soul,7,6,203
8,jaime, someone certainly does  you’re an anointed knight there’s quite a difference  you have better instincts than any officer in the lannister army  i expect to command all the lannister forces before long you can be the right hand i lost  lothar is it  ‘cause you didn’t set up a proper perimeter you just allowed 8000 men to approach unchallenged  have lord edmure bathed and fed  only a fool makes threats he’s not prepared to carry out now let’s say i threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth but you kept talking what do you think i’d do  i’m here by the king’s command to take back this castle have him bathed and fed unless you’d like to take his place  the siege is now under my command the next time the blackfish looks out from those ramparts he’ll see an army at his gates not whatever this is  as i said the siege is under my command if that’s not to your liking go home  get word to the blackfish i want a parley  he’s an old man  blackfish  i don’t have them  it won’t stop with edmure you’ll force me to storm the castle hundreds will die  we’ll breach them and kill every last one of you but if you surrender i’ll spare the lives of your men on my honor  the war is over ser why sacrifice living men to a lost cause  you clearly have no intention of saving your men’s lives why did you come to treat with me  well now you have,7,6,259
9,jon, that’s what’ll happen to you if we lose the boltons the karstarks the umbers they know you’re here they know that more than half of you are women and children after they finish with me they’ll come for you you’re right this isn’t your fight you shouldn’t have to come to winterfell with me i shouldn’t be asking you it’s not the deal we made i need you with me if we’re gonna beat them and we need to beat them if you’re going to survive  are you sure they’ll come  lady mormont  robb is gone but house stark is not and it needs your support now more than ever i’ve come with my sister to ask for house mormont’s allegiance  your uncle fought them at the fist of the first men i fought them at hardhome we both lost  thank you my lady how many fighting men can we expect  62  lord glover if you could just hear us out  house mormont  the bulk of the force is made up of wildlings  lord glover  we’re not staying here long another storm could hit any day  we have to march on winterfell now while we still can  ser davos is the reason i’m standing here talking to you and he served stannis for years  there’s no time  we fight with the army we have,7,6,224
10,lem, what are you doing here  protecting the people  do you have any horses  food then protecting the people is hungry work  stay safe the night is dark and full of terrors,7,6,31
11,lothar, come out and fight us blackfish yield the castle or we’ll hang him  this is your last warning yield the castle  ser jaime we didn’t know you were coming  walder  apologies ser jaime  do as he says,7,6,37
12,lyanna, welcome to bear island  i doubt it my mother wasn’t a great beauty or any other kind of beauty she was a great warrior though she died fighting for your brother robb  i think we’ve had enough small talk what are you here  i remember what it said “bear island knows no king but the king in the north whose name is stark”  as far as i understand you’re a snow and lady sansa is a bolton or is she a lannister i’ve heard conflicting reports  if you say so in any case you don’t just want my allegiance you want my fighting men  i understand that i’m responsible for bear island and all who live here so why should i sacrifice one more mormont life for someone else’s war  i don’t know you ser…  all right ser davos of house seaworth how is it you understand how i feel  go on ser davos  is this true  house mormont has kept faith with house stark for 1000 years we will not break faith today  62  we are not a large house but we’re a proud one and every man from bear island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders,7,6,199
13,man, that’s it get it to the top  pick the pace up keep going  who the fuck are you  he’s not a lying man he says the iron fleet’s in slaver’s bay i’m inclined to believe him i’m not going anywhere near those mad fuckers  what do you care  you can’t afford it  where’d you steal this from  we leave in two days you can have a hammock in steerage,7,6,69
14,man #2, steady steady  keep it moving  yeah who the fuck are you,7,6,11
15,margaery, the book of the mother your holiness chapter three verse 12  “smoothing what was jagged so does a woman’s love calm a man’s brute nature a wife salves her husband’s wounds a mother sings her son to sleep”  for year i pretended to love the poor the afflicted i had pity for them but i never loved them they disgusted me  of course  no  it’s justthe desires that once drove me no longer do  forgive me sometimes the truth path is hard to find  my grandmother  septa unella has been my true friend and counselor  grandmother  grandmother please  you marched against the high sparrow against the faith  the gods could have punished you and father but they didn’t they showed mercy  loras’s only hope is to confess his crimes and repent if he does the faith will allow him to return to highgarden he’ll have to renounce his name and title  and live his life as a penitent  he can begin again  as a free man  i am the queen it is my duty to serve my husband the king  but you should leave grandmother your place is at home  you must  go home find comfort in prayer and good works  the mother watches over us all  seven blessings to you grandmother  shall we pray,7,6,215
16,olenna, does it move or talk i want to speak with you alone  oh this is madness  you’re not in your sanctuary now my dear all i have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about  until i tell them to stop if i tell them to stop you could use a good bashing  what have they done to you  we marched for you  and what about your brother what mercy did they show him  have you lost your mind  he is the heir to highgarden the future of house tyrell  as a mindless fanatic  you will leave for highgarden today there is no law that says you must stay here  i will never leave you never  i’ll see you soon my dear  that is hardly your concern  loras rots in a cell because of you the high sparrow rules this city because of you our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity  good  i wonder if you’re the worst person i’ve ever met at a certain age it’s hard to recall but the truly vile do stand out through the years do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells i do i’ll never forget it  i’m leaving this wretched city as fast as i can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells if you’re half as bright as you think you are you’ll find your way out of here too  what’ll you do then you have no support not anymore your brother’s gone the high sparrow saw to that the rest of your family have abandoned you the people despise you you’re surrounded by enemies thousands of them you’re going to kill them all by yourself you’ve lost cersei it’s the only joy i can find in all this misery,7,6,317
17,ray, up she goes  hey come on put your back into it huh  here you are son  oh gentlemen please  in all my days i’ve never seen a man swing an ax like that how many men did it take to cut you down  ooh he must have been some kind of monster  i think some of the men are a bit afraid of you  when i found you i thought you’d been dead for days the way you were stinking already and you had bugs all over you and bone was coming through right there  i was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed oh nearly shit myself i reckoned you were gonna die by the time i loaded you on the wagon but you didn’t now i reckoned you’d die a dozen more times over the next few days but you didn’t what kept you going  no there’s a reason you’re still here  no a reason gods aren’t done with you yet  well maybe he was right i don’t know much about the gods  oh there’s plenty of pious sons of bitches who think they know the word of god or gods i don’t i don’t even know their real names maybe it is the seven or maybe it’s the old gods or maybe it’s the lord of light or maybe they’re all the same fucking thing i don’t know what matters i believe is that there’s something greater than us and whatever it is it’s got plans for sandor clegane  i’ve heard stories  they have  i was a soldier once all my superiors thought i was brave i wasn’t i mean i never ran from a fight only because i was afraid my friends would see i was afraid that’s all i was a coward we followed orders no matter the orders burn that village fine i’m your arsonist steal that farmer’s crops good i’m your thief kill those young lads so they won’t take up arms against us i’m your murderer i remember once a woman screaming at us calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut but we weren’t animals animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours i cut that young boy’s throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back  that nighti felt such shame shame was so heavy on me i couldn’t eat i couldn’t sleep  all i could do was stare into that dark sky and listen to that mother screaming her son’s name i’ll hear her screaming the rest of my life  now i know i can never bring that lad back all i can do with time i’ve got left is bring a little goodness into the world that’s all any of us can do isn’t it never too late to stop robbing people to stop killing people start helping people  it’s never too late to come back  and it’s not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers it’s not even about the gods it’s about you learning you have to answer your prayers yourself  seven save you friends how can we help you  well we’re talking about life you  well we thank you for your protection who are you protecting us from  no horses no gold no steel  i’m sure it is you’re welcome to stay for supper but we have hungry mouths here  i’m a fucking septon what was i supposed to say  aye well all are welcome here anyway we got nothing for them  what do you want to do fight them kill them  it’d be you against all of them i mean these people don’t know how to fight  i’m done with fighting  violence is a disease you don’t cure a disease by spreading it to more people  you’ve done enough work for one day come on up for some supper  i’ll save you a bowl of stew might even have some ale hidden away,7,6,663
18,robett, the answer is no  i’ve heard enough we’ve only just taken back this castle from the ironborn the boltons helped us do it now you want me to fight against them i could be skinned for even talking to you  have other northern houses pledged to fight for you  and  i don’t care about ravens you’re asking me to join your army who is fighting in this army  then the rumors are true i didn’t dare believe them i received you out of respect for your father now i would like you to leave house glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings  there’s nothing else to say  yes my family served house stark for centuries we wept when we heard of your father’s death when my brother was lord of this castle he answered robb’s call and hailed him king in the north  and where was king robb when the ironborn attacked this castle when they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects taking up with a foreign whore getting himself and those who followed him killed  i served house stark once but house stark is dead,7,6,197
19,sandor, just one  he was a woman  i’m used to it  hate  aye there’s a reason i’m a big fucker and i’m tough to kill  i’ve heard that before man was talking about a different god though  you’re in the wrong line of work  you didn’t know me back in my time you don’t know the things i’ve done  if the gods are realwhy haven’t they punished me  “seven save you friends”  they don’t believe in your seven they’re from the brotherhood they follow the red god  sure you do you’ve got food you’ve got steel even if you say you don’t and you’ve got women  you do  even if it’s to protect yourself  you don’t cure it by dying either  it’s gonna be a cold night we’ll need firewood,7,6,129
20,sansa, i remember when you were born my lady you were named for my aunt lyanna it was said she was a great beauty i’m sure you will be too  i did what i had to do to survive my lady but i am a stark i will always be a stark  i would remind you that house glover is pledged to house stark sworn to answer when called upon  and that’s a good thing  62 mormonts  so he’s your most trusted advisor now because he secured 62 men from a ten year old  stannis who lost the blackwater who murdered his own brother who doesn’t have a head  it’s not enough we need more men,7,6,115
21,theon, why did we have to come here  i don’t want one  you think uncle euron’s hunting for us  he’ll find us  i don’t want any  some bad years  if i got justice my burnt body would hang over the gates of winterfell,7,6,42
22,tormund, if it weren’t for him none of us would be here all of you would be meat in the night king’s army and i’d be a pile of charred bones just like mance  the crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would he died for us if we are not willing to do the same for him we’re cowards and if that’s what we are we deserve to be the last of the free folk  we’re not clever like you southerners when we say we’ll do something we do it,7,6,97

13,jaime, i never thought you’d find her i just assumed sansa was dead  in my experience girls like her don’t live very long  well i’m proud of you i am you fulfilled your oath to catelyn stark against all odds  of course my sister wants sansa dead the girl is still a suspect in joffrey’s murder so there is that complication what the hell are you doing here  you’re welcome to have him  with what army does she plan on taking winterfell  they’re a bit occupied at the moment i was sent here to reclaim riverrun currently defended by the tully rebels so you can see the conundrum  riverrun was granted to the freys by royal decree  exactly  we shouldn’t argue about politics  i’m a lannister don’t ask me to betray my own house  what do you propose  why would he abandon his ancestral home  have you ever met the blackfish  he’s even more stubborn than you are  all right try to talk some sense into the old goat he won’t listen but his men might not everybody wants to die for someone else’s home  you have my word you have until nightfall  it’s yours it will always be yours  yes lady brienne  of course it does  let’s hope it doesn’t come to that  lord edmure  i apologize for the way the freys treated you a man of your birth deserved better you have my word you’ll be properly fed and clothes from now on  the blackfish is an old man a good death is all he can hope for but you you have a child now i’ve heard a son you sired on your wedding night you’re a potent man  you should be with them both i can arrange that you realize comfortable rooms for you at casterly rock a tutor for your boy knights to train him to fight and to ride and when he comes of age he’ll have a keep of his own  i’ll remind you that our houses are at war i’m sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you but rebelling against the crown does have consequences  did i give you the impression that this was a negotiation it’s not  i’ll leave the judgments to the gods  i was your sister’s prisoner once she hit me on the head with a rock if i remember correctly  perhaps but she didn’t catelyn stark hated me just like you hate me but i didn’t hate her i admired her far more than her husband or her son  no i don’t but i’m telling you anyway because you’re my prisoner you don’t have a choice the love she had for her children i was a little awed by it reminded me of my sister  i’ll talk about whomever i want  she loved her children i suppose all mothers do but catelyn and cersei there’s a fierceness you don’t often see  they’d do anything to protect their babies  start a war burn cities to ash free their worst enemies the things we do for love  that’s exactly why i came here i love cersei you can laugh at that if you want you can sneer it doesn’t matter she needs me and to get back to her i have to take riverrun i’ll send for your baby boy  and i’ll launch him into riverrun with a catapult because you don’t matter to me lord edmure your son doesn’t matter to me the people in the castle don’t matter to me only cersei and if i have to slaughter every tully who ever lived to get back to her that’s what i’ll do  good bring him to me,8,6,607

25,thoros, what the fuck you doing here  hanging them  you’ve got friends  no no no  we’re not butchers we hang them  they die  you’re getting old clegane  enjoying yourself  clegane we’re here for a reason the lord of light is keeping beric alive for a reason he gave a failed drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason we are part of something larger than ourselves,8,6,68
26,tommen, lords and ladies the faith and the crown are the two pillars that hold up this world one collapses so does the other the father judges us all if you break his lawsyou will be punished after conferring with his holiness the high septon we have determined that loras tyrell and cersei lannister’s trial will be held in the great sept of baelor on the first day of the festival of the mother  furthermore after much prayer and reflection the crown has decided that from this day forward trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the seven kingdoms the tradition is a brutish one a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods cersei lannister and loras tyrell will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the faith seven blessings to all,8,6,144
27,tyrion, i’d call that a successful gambit  look around the city has come back to life  i did and it worked  spoken like a man who has never had to shave  i’m going to miss you  i hope you’re right about this expedition of yours  most of all we need our queen  varys  the most famous dwarf in the world  i am happy you should both be as well not so long ago this city was ready to devour itself  now it’s like a man reborn  why don’t you drink why don’t either of you ever drink  why not  and who made these rules your former masters  those miserable old shits didn’t want you to be human have a drink with me  and you what’s your excuse  that’s how you know it’s working  here’s to our queen anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen  to daenerys stormborn mother of dragons breaker of chains long may she reign  do you like it  yes yes fermentation one day after our queen has taken the seven kingdomsi’d like to have my own vineyard make my own wine the imp’s delight only my close friends could drink it  tell me a joke missandei of naath  grey worm  but when the barkeep brings them over each of them finds a fly in his cup the lannister outraged shoves the cup aside and demands another the martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole the stark reaches into his cup pulls out the fly and shouts “spit it out you see shit spit it out”  it’s funnier in westeros  yes  a story that’s supposed to make you laugh ideally not at the moment perhaps  missandei do you like the wine  tell a joke  you lied to us  i was wrong i admit it  all right what should the army do  and then,8,6,306
28,varys, would you  you made a pact with fanatics  if you shaved your beard with a straight razor you’d say the razor worked that doesn’t mean it won’t cut your throat  i know  if i don’t return you’ll know i was wrong  she’ll come back she has to my heart’s been broken too many times already  i’ll walk the rest of the way myself i can’t go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city,8,6,82
29,waif, if you’d have done your job she would have died painlessly  instead…  the many-faced god was promised a name he must always receive what is his you can’t change that i can’t change that no one can and now he’s been promised another name  it will all be over soon on your knees or on your feet  haven’t we been through this already that won’t help you,8,6,67

3,davos, that’s not his way he knows the north is watching if the other houses sense weakness on his part they’ll stop fearing him he can’t have that fear is his power  it’s crucial that we let them charge at us they’ve got the numbers we need the patience if we let him buckle our center he’ll pursue then we’ll have him surrounded on three sides  we should all get some sleep  you think there’s hope  it wasn’t the boltons defeated stannis it was stannis himself i loved the man he lifted me up and made me something but he had demons in his skull whispering foul things  what  no it’s a manner of speaking not actual demons  maybe that was our mistake believing in kings  no he’s not  no thanks it does sound delicious but i better keep a clear head i can never sleep the night before a battle  i walk think and walk think and walk until i’m far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out  prepare to charge prepare to charge  go go follow your commander  we’ll just kill our own men stand down  we may as well be taking shits back here  follow  with me lads break their line,9,6,210

12,razdal, once before i offered you peace if you had not been so arrogant you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships instead you will flee slaver’s bay on foot like the beggar queen you are  i imagine it’s difficult adjust to the new reality your reign is over  him he should die  he’s not one of us he’s an outsider a lowborn he does not speak for us,9,6,72
13,sansa, yes i do  how do we know you have him  you’re going to die tomorrow lord bolton sleep well  so you’ve met the enemy drawn up your battle plans  you’ve known him for the space of a single conversation you and your trusted advisors and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don’t know i lived with him i know the way his mind works i know how he likes to hurt people did it ever once occur to you that i might have some insight  you think he’s going to fall into your trap he won’t he’s the one who lays traps  he plays with people he’s far better at it than you he’s been doing it all his life  you don’t know him  we’ll never get him back rickon is ned starks trueborn son which makes him a greater threat to ramsay than you a bastard or me a girl as long as he lives ramsay’s claim to winterfell will be contested which means he won’t live long  listen to me please he wants you to make a mistake  i don’t know i don’t know anything about battles just don’t do what he wants you to do  you think that’s obvious  if you had asked for my advice earlier i would have told you not to attack winterfell until we have a larger force or is that obvious too  it’s not enough  if ramsay wins i’m not going back there alive do you understand me  no one can protect me no one can protect anyone  jon  where is he  your words will disappear your house will disappear your name will disappear all memory of you will disappear  you haven’t fed them in seven days you said it yourself  they were now they’re starving,9,6,302
14,smalljon, who owns the north  who owns the north  show me,9,6,10
15,theon, it was a long time ago  i didn’t murder the stark boys but i did things that were just as bad or worse  not my claim hers  i’m not fit to rule  our uncle euron returned home after a long absence he murdered our father and took the salt throne from yara he would have murdered us if we had stayed  there are and euron is building more he’s going to offer them to you  the iron fleet isn’t all he’s bringing he also wants to give you --  he murdered our father and would have murdered us he’ll murder you as soon as you have what he wants  all of them  your ancestors defeated ours and took the iron islands we ask you to give them back,9,6,128
16,tormund, it’s not his men that worry me it’s his horses i know what mounted knights can do to us  you and stannis cut through us like piss through snow  good  did you really think that cunt would fight you man to man  rest jon snow we need you sharp tomorrow  i’ve never seen these bolton fuckers fight and they’ve never seen the free folk fight so yes there’s hope you want to avenge your king don’t you  you saw these demons  oh well you loved that cunt stannis and i loved the man he burned mance didn’t have demons in his skull he didn’t torch people or listen to some red witch i believed in him i thought he was the man to lead us through the long night but i was wrong just like you  jon snow’s not a king  i need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight you want some i have a jug of sour goat’s milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on  so what do you do all night  happy shitting  don’t  run and fight  hey  fuck this come on,9,6,197
17,tyrion, despite appearances i think you’ll find the city’s on the rise  perhaps we should take shelter  meereen is strong commerce has returned to the markets the people are behind you  well not all the people of course no ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people but the rebirth of meereen is the cause of this violence the masters cannot let meereen succeed because if meereen succeeds a city without slavery a city without masters…  it proves that no one needs a master  do we have a plan  you once told me you knew what your father was did you know his plans for king’s landing when the lannister armies were at his gates  probably not well he told my brother and jaime told me he had caches of wildfire hidden under the red keep the guildhalls the sept of baelor all the major thoroughfares he would have burned every one of his citizens the loyal ones and the trators every man woman and child that’s why jaime killed him  you’re talking about destroying cities it’s not entirely different i’d like to suggest an alternate approach  we are here to discuss terms of surrender not to trade insults  thank you for the armada our queen does love ships now last time we spoke we made a pact you violated that pact you declared war upon us though our queen does have a forgiving nature this cannot be forgiven  it always seems a bit abstract doesn’t it other people dying  tell your people what happened here tell them you live by the grace of her majesty when they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory remind the what happened when daenerys stormborn and her dragons came to meereen  last time we saw each other was at winterfell yes you were making jokes about my height i seem to recall everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf’s height thinks he’s the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf’s height “the height of nobility” “a man of your stature” “someone to look up to” you’re all making the same five or six jokes  it was and how have things been going for you since then not so well i gather can’t imagine you would have murdered the stark boys if things had been going well  doesn’t seem like it he’s still alive it was complicated for you i’m sure growing up at winterfell never quite knowing who you were but then we all live complicated lives don’t we  we can agree upon that at least  with the former masters’ fleet possibly barely there are more than 100 ships in the iron fleet  the seven kingdoms  what if everyone starts demanding their independence,9,6,466
18,yara, and he paid for them  no more than westeros  you and i have that in common  his big cock i think he said euron’s offer is also an offer of marriage you see you won’t get one without the other  i never demand but i’m up for anything really  we’d like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don’t think a woman’s fit to rule  that’s our way of life  no more,9,6,75
19,yezzan, the terms are simple you and your foreign friends will abandon the great pyramid and the city of meereen the unsullied you stole from kraznys mo nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder the translator you stole from kraznys mo nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder the dragons beneath the great pyramid will be slaughtered  please,9,6,65
1,all, the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north  long may she reign,10,6,44
2,arya, my name is arya stark i want you to know that the last thing you’re ever going to see is a stark smiling down at you as you die,10,6,29
3,attendant, your grace the trial will be getting underway soon  i’m very sorry your grace very sorry,10,6,16
4,benjen, this is where i leave you  the wall is not just ice and stone ancient spells were carved into its foundations strong magic to protect men from what lies beyond and while it stands the dead cannot pass i cannot pass  the great war is coming and i still fight for the living i’ll do what i can… as long as i can  i wish you both good fortune,10,6,69
5,bran, thank you uncle benjen,10,6,4
6,bronn, you don’t even have to do anything do you  you just sit there a rich slab of beef and all the birds come pecking  she doesn’t want me she wants your golden fingers up her twat  they have their eyes on you cunt  not blonde enough  maybe i’m not in the mood  fuck it  no need to call me ser just because i’m an anointed knight,10,6,66
7,cersei, confess confess  confess  confess it felt good beating me starving me frightening me humiliating me you didn’t do it because you cared about my atonement you did it because it felt good i understand i do things because they feel good i drink because it feels good i killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him i fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me i lie about fucking my brother… because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites i killed your high sparrow… and all his little sparrows… all his septons all his septas all his filthy soldiers because it felt good to watch them burn it felt good to imagine their shock and their pain no thought has ever given me greater joy even confessing feels good under the right circumstances  you’ve always been quiet  i said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died do you remember  what now today you’re not going to die today you’re not going to die for quite a while ser gregor  this is ser gregor clegane he’s quiet too  your gods have forsaken you this is your god now  shame  shame  shame  show me  show me  he should be with his grandfather his brother his sister burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood,10,6,232
8,daario, your ships are nearly ready i saw them painting the sails  i’m curious to see how the dothraki do on the poison water  new strategy you want the second sons to attack from the west coast if we take casterly rock the lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit king’s landing  fuck meereen fuck the people i’m here for you not them  who are you marrying this time  but you need to lure all the noble houses to the table are you a queen or fish bait  a king wouldn’t think twice about it  i’m not proud i don’t care what perfumed aristocrat sits beside you in the throne room i don’t want a crown i want you  i love you and i make you happy you know i do bring me with you let me fight for you  the dwarf told you to do this  clever fellow can’t argue with his logic i’m no use to you over there  i’m not angry i’m full of self-pity who comes after you who can ever follow daenerys stormborn the mother of dragons  bay of dragons  you’ll get that throne you want so badly i’m sure of it i hope it brings you happiness  i pity the lord of westeros they have no idea what’s coming for them,10,6,218
9,daenerys, you’re not coming with us  you’re not going to westeros you’re staying here with the second sons there’s finally peace in meereen you will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders  you promised me “my sword is yours my life is yours” this is what i command if i’m going to rule in westeros i’ll need to make alliances the best way to make alliances is with marriage  i don’t know maybe no one  i can’t bring a lover to westeros  so that’s what you want to be my mistress  i can’t  no one tells me to do anything  don’t get angry  a great number of women i imagine specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of meereen and the bay of dragons  we can’t call it slaver’s bay anymore can we  farewell daario naharis  no tears  it’s not  yes you really are  do you know what frightens me i said farewell to a man who loves me a man i thought i cared for and i felt nothing just impatient to get on with it  well you have completely failed to console me  it’s your counsel i need  good i um… i had something made for you i’m not sure if it’s right  tyrion lannister i name you hand of the queen,10,6,219
10,davos, tell him tell him who it belonged to  tell him what you did to her tell him  why  you burned a little girl alive  if he commands you to burn children your lord is evil  i loved that girl like she was my own she was good she was kind and you killed her  the only way for what they all died anyway you told everyone stannis was the one you had him believing it all of them fooled and you lied  aye you were wrong how many died because you were wrong  i ask your leave to execute this woman for murder she admits to the crime  if you ever come back this way i will execute you myself,10,6,120
11,ellaria, you have nothing to fear from us lady olenna  the lannisters have declared war on house tyrell they have declared war on dorne we must be allies now if we wish to survive  you’re absolutely right i chose the wrong words it is not survival i offer it is your heart’s desire  vengeance justice,10,6,54
12,girl, grand maester,10,6,2
13,glover, i did not fight beside you on the field and i will regret that until my dying day a man can only admit when he was wrong and ask forgiveness  there will be more fights to come house glover will stand behind house stark as we have for a thousands years and i will stand behind jon snow… the king in the north  the king in the north,10,6,68
14,handmaiden, no my lord  they’re here my lord  but they’re already here my lord  here my lord  they weren’t easy to carve especially black walder,10,6,24
15,high sparrow, ser loras tyrell are you prepared to stand trial and profess your guilt or innocence before the seven  to which crimes will you be confessing  the gods’ judgment is fierce but also fair the warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice but the mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her  you understand fully what this means  brother loras…  i ask you to dedicate your life to the seven gods  will you fight to defend your faith against heretics and apostates  i’ve kept my word once the queen mother’s trial is concluded brother loras is free to leave  it appears the queen mother doesn’t wish to attend her own trial  go to the red keep and show her the way  you have nothing to fear your grace the trial will begin shortly  if the accused is not here she will be tried regardless we cannot escape the justice of the gods--,10,6,157
16,jaime, you’re welcome to her  those two have their eyes on you  not my type  ladies have you met ser bronn of the blackwater hero of the battle of blackwater bay  there you go  i’m sure he would be  have you done much fighting yourself lord frey  no but back in your day  yes you’re a great conqueror  they don’t fear the freys though they fear the lannisters we gave you the riverlands to hold the riverlands if we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them why do we need you  come on,10,6,100
17,jon, when we had feasts our family would sit up here… and i’d sit down there  aye you’re right i was luckier than most  what is that  do you have anything to say for yourself  ride south today if you return to the north i’ll have you hanged as a murderer  i’m having the lord’s chamber prepared for you  i’m not a stark  you’re the lady of winterfell you deserve it we’re standing here because of you the battle was lost until the knights of the vale rode in they came because of you you told me lord baelish sold you to the boltons  and you trust him  we need to trust each other we can’t fight a war amongst ourselves we have so many enemies now  well father always promised didn’t he  the free folk the northerners and the knights of the vale fought bravely fought together and we won my father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield  the war is not over and i promise you friend the true enemy won’t wait out the storm he brings the storm  there’s nothing to forgive my lord,10,6,191
18,lancel, her litter never left the red keep  get the others  the longer you wait the worse it’ll be for you  what are you doing,10,6,24
19,loras, there’ll be no need for a trial i confess before the seven and freely admit to my crimes  all of them i lay with other men including the traitor renly baratheon  i perjured myself before the gods i am guilty of depravity… dishonesty profligacy and arrogance i see that now i humble myself before the seven and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just  i take full responsibility for my many sins and unburden myself of my desires my only remaining wish is to devote my life to the seven may i be a living example of their grace for others to witness  i do i will abandon the tyrell name and all that goes with it i will renounce my lordship and my claims on highgarden i will never marry and i will never father children  i will,10,6,139

21,mace, no i can’t let them…,10,6,5
22,man, the boltons are defeated the war is over winter has come if the maesters are right it’ll be the coldest one in a thousand years we should ride home and wait out the coming storms,10,6,35
23,manderly, lady mormont speaks harshly and truly my son died for robb stark the young wolf i didn’t think we’d find another king in my lifetime i didn’t commit my men to your cause ‘cause i didn’t want more manderlys dying for nothing but i was wrong jon snow avenged the red wedding he is the white wolf the king in the north,10,6,62

33,petyr, forgive me my lady… if you’re at prayer  you were a child  i thought you knew what i wanted  no you weren’t every time i’m faced with a decision i close my eyes and see the same picture whenever i consider an action i ask myself will this action help to make this picture a reality pull it out of my mind and into the world and i only act if the answer is yes a picture of me on the iron throne… and you by my side  news of this battle will spread quickly through the seven kingdoms i’ve declared for house stark for all to hear  the past is gone for good you can sit here mourning its departure or you can prepare for the future you my love are the future of house stark who should the north rally behind a trueborn daughter of ned and catelyn stark born here at winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south,10,6,163
34,pycelle, later go away  where’s the king,10,6,6
35,qyburn, elsewhere i’m afraid  please grand maester i bear you no ill will please forgive me if you can  this pains me my lord whatever your faults you do not deserve to die alone in such a cold dark place but sometimes before we can usher in the new the old must be put to rest  your grace there’s no need--  what are your thoughts concerning the king’s funeral as the sept of baelor is no longer an option perhaps a ceremony in the throne room  i now proclaim cersei of the house lannister first of her name queen of the andals and the first men protector of the seven kingdoms  long may she reign,10,6,114
36,sam, hello  from lord commander snow at castle black  he died  maester aemon became quite ill shortly after the election he’s since passed away which is why i’m here  yes well i suppose that life is irregular,10,6,36

38,septa unella, no  good i’m glad to see your face i’m ready to meet the gods  no,10,6,15
39,tommen, all right i’m ready,10,6,4
40,tormund, we didn’t invade we were invited,10,6,6
41,tyrion, how did he take it  i know it was hard for you you turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the seven kingdoms that’s the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler if it’s any consolation  no i suppose not i’m terrible at consoling  all right how about the fact that this is actually happening you have your armies you have your ships you have your dragons everything you’ve ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything it’s all yours for the taking are you afraid  good you’re in the great game now and the great game’s terrifying the only people who aren’t afraid of failure are madmen like your father  he wasn’t the first to love you and he won’t be the last  i believe in you it’s embarrassing really i’d swear you my sword but i don’t actually own a sword  it’s yours now and always,10,6,161

8,euron, the moment i was chosen lord of the iron islands they turned on me their own uncle they stole my best ships and ran sailed the right across the world and gave them to the dragon queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you  it's nothing compares to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family members from what i hear but still it bothers me murdering them would make me feel a lot better and since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side i thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together  i remember very well i saw you i heard so much talk the best in the world no one can stop him i didn't believe it to be honesty but i must say when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people downit was glorious like a dance  the place was getting crowded i enjoyed watching it i truly did  a good thing for me if you hadn't crushed us i wouldn't have gone into exile if i hadn't done that i wouldn't be the greatest captain on the 14 seas  you're not humble you're the queen of a great nation you don't care about the iron islands they're nothing but rocks and bird shit and--and a lot of very unattractive people the iron fleet on the other hand that's something else entirely it's the greatest armada westeros has ever seen with the iron fleet you own the seas you can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south  ever since i was a little boy i wanted to grow up and mary the most beautiful woman in the world so here i am with a thousand ships and two good hands  why  you should try it feels wonderful  i don't expect you to trust me outright you need proof of my honest intentions in my experience the surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift a priceless gift i won't return to king's landing until i have that for you,1,7,355

10,jaime, what is this  he knew it made me memorize every damn city town lake forest and mountain  no not angry  should i be  dragonstone  they have deep-water ports for the ships stannis left the castle unoccupied and that's where she was born  winter is here we can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses the tyrells have the grain the tyrells have the livestock  if they think daenerys will win no one wants to fight on the losing side right now we look like the losing side  three kingdoms at best i'm not sure you understand how much danger we're in  a dynasty for whom our children are dead we're the last of us  we never talked about tommen  our baby boy killed himself  cersei--  even lannisters can't survive without allies where are our allies now you saw what happened to walder frey and his family  we couldn't he was a useless old coward but the freys supported us now they're all dead whoever killed them is no friend of ours we need allies stronger better allies we can't win this war alone  the greyjoys you invited the greyjoys to king's landing  well it looks like all of them  how are they better allies how are they different from the freys they both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them  they're not good at anything i know the ironborn they're bitter angry little people all they know how to do is steal things they can't build or grow themselves  oh what did he come here for then  you're not a rightful monarch though are you  the greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs but as i recall you were soundly defeated come to mention it weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to casterly rock and burning the lannister fleet you certainly caught us there very smart move on your part of course we all made it to the iron islands anyway i was there  the people i was cutting down were your own kin  and i enjoyed killing greyjoys,1,7,359
11,jon," i want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass dragonglass kills white walkers it's more valuable to us now than gold we need to find it we need to mine it we need to make weapons from it everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears pikes bow and arrow  not just the boys  we can't defend the north if only half the population is fighting  while we're preparing for attack we need to shore up our defenses the only thing standing between us and the army of the dead is the wall and the wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries i'm not the king of the free folk  but if we're going to survive this winter together  last time we saw the night king was at hardhome the closest castle to hardhome is eastwatch-by-the-sea  if they breach the wall the first two castles in their path are last hearth and karhold  the umbers and the karstarks have fought beside the starks for centuries they've kept faith for generation after generation  i'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons  the punishment for treason is death smalljon umber died on the field of battle harald karstark died on the field of battle  when i was lord commander of the night's watch i executed men who betrayed me i executed men who refused to follow orders my father always said ""the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword"" and i have tried to live by those words but i will not punish a son for his father's sins and i will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries that is my decision and my decision is final  ned umber  alys karstark  for centuries our families fought side by side on the battlefield i ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to house stark to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon  stand  yesterday's wars don't matter anymore the north needs to band together all the living north will you stand beside me ned and alys now and always  you are my sister but i am king now  when you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies you undermine me  of course you can but--  do you think i'm joffrey  thank you  at what  no  what did father used to say everything before the word ""but"" is horse shit  no no he never cursed in front of his girls  all right i'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me  and how should i be smarter by listening to you  ""cersei of house lannister first of her name queen of the andals and the first men protector of the seven kingdoms--""  come to king's landing bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors  i'm consumed with the night king because i've seen him and believe me you'd think of little else if you had too  there's a thousand miles between us and cersei winter is here the lannisters are a southern army they've never ranged this far north  you almost sound as if you admire her",1,7,549

23,sam, archmaester i was wondering  um 147  i was wondering if you had considered my proposition  i asked you if in light of what i've seen in the north if i could have access to the restricted area of the library  no  archmaester with respect i've seen them--the army of the dead the white walkers w was sent here to learn how to defeat them but everyone in the citadel those who will even talk to me they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place  sources in the restricted area  so you believe me  that makes you the only person south of the twins who does  the dead don't  the targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the first men used it for  it's a map of dragonstone the targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded westeros  a mountain of it beneath the ground stannis told me but i didn't think this is important jon needs to know  who  haven't heard anything,1,7,170

25,sansa, the castles committed no crimes and we need every fortress we have for the war to come we should give the last hearth and karhold to new families loyal families who supported us against ramsay  and then they broke faith  so there's no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty  they died fighting for ramsay give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you  will you start wearing a crown  so i can't question your decisions anymore  joffrey never let anyone question his authority you think he was a good king  you're as far from joffrey as anyone i've ever met  you're good at this you know  at ruling  you are you are they respect you they really do but you have to--  why are you laughing  he never said that to me  because he was trying to protect us he never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is but father couldn't protect me and neither can you stop trying  i'm not trying to undermine you  you have to be smarter than father you need to be smarter than robb i loved them i miss them but they made stupid mistakes and they both lost their heads for it  would that be so terrible  what does she want  you've been so consumed with the enemy to the north you've forgotten about the one to the south  we still have a wall between us and the night king theres nothing between us and cersei  you're the military man but i know her if you're her enemy she'll never stop until she's destroyed you everyone who's ever crossed her she's found a way to murder  i learned a great deal from her  what do you want lord baelish  i am safe i'm at home surrounded by friends i have brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me  at the moment peace and quiet  no need to seize the last word lord baelish i'll assume it was something clever  we need his men without the vale ramsay bolton would still hold this castle littlefinger saved us  i know exactly what he wants,1,7,360

1,cersei,  if the mad king's daughter takes the iron throne she will destroy the realm as we know it  some of you are bannermen of house tyrell  but house tyrell is in open rebellion against the crown  with their help the mad king's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores  mindless unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts  dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground rape and enslave your women and butcher your children without a second thought  this is how olenna tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty   you all remember the mad king  you remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people  his daughter is no different  in essos her brutality is already legendary  she crucified hundreds of noblemen in slaver's bay  and when she grew bored of that she fed them to her dragons   it is my solemn duty to protect the people and i will but i need your help my lords  we must stand together all of us if we hope to stop her   no i can't say i have  i haven't seen these since robert had them removed from the throne room   they were his trophies  he couldn't keep them around  they would have made him look small  sometimes he would come down here and look at them  i believe he brought his whores on occasion,2,7,230
2,daenerys, i wish i could remember it  i always thought this would be a homecoming it doesn't feel like home  good  not so many lions  they cry out for their true queen they drink secret toasts to my health  people used to tell my brother that sort of thing and he was stupid enough to believe them  if viserys had three dragons and an army at his back he'd have invaded king's landing already  no  i never properly thanked you for that  you served my father didn't you lord varys  and then you served the man who overthrew him  but you didn't serve him long you turned against him  so you took it upon yourself to find a better one  before i came to power you favored my brother all your spies your little birds did they tell you viserys was cruel stupid and weak would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion  so you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the dothraki  who gave the order to kill me  who hired the assassins  who sent word to essos to murder daenerys targaryen  to keep yourself alive  proven himself loyal quite the opposite if he dislikes one monarch he conspires to crown the next one what king of a servant is that  swear this to me varys if you ever think i'm failing the people you won't conspire behind my back you'll look me in the eye as you have done today and you'll tell me how i'm failing them  and i swear this--if you ever betray me i'll burn you alive   the red priests helped bring peace to meereen  you are very welcome here  what is your name   you chose an auspicious day to arrive at dragonstone   we've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king   the lord of light doesn't have  many followers in westeros does he   what does your lord expect from me   the prince who was promised will bring the dawn  i'm afraid i'm not a prince   no but i like it better   and you believe this prophecy refers to me   you know him   he sounds like quite a man   very well  send a raven north  tell jon snow that his queen invites him to come to drangonstoneand bend the knee   that's enough  tyrion is the hand of the queen  you will treat him with respect   i am not here to be queen of the ashes   i'm grateful to you lady olenna for your council  i'm grateful to all of you  but you have chosen to follow me  i will not attack king's landing  we will not attack king's landing   we will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides  cersei will have the iron throne but no food for her army or the people   do i have your support   thank you all  lady olenna may i speak with you alone   i realize you're here out of hatred for cersei and not love for me  but i swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to westeros,2,7,522

19,melisandre,  queen daeneys i was a slave once bought and sold scourged and branded  it is an honor to meet the breaker of chains   i am called melisandre   no it didn't   the long night is coming  only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn   prophecies are dangerous things  i believe you have a role to play as does another  the king in the north jon snow   as lord commander of the night's watch he allowed the wildlings south of the wall to protect them from great danger  as king in the north he has united those wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy   summon jon snow  let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him the things that he has seen with his own eyes,2,7,137
20,melisdandre,  not yet   but even those who don't worship the lord can serve his cause,2,7,14
21,missandei,  your grace forgive me but your translation is not quite accurate  that noun has no gender in high valyrian so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn   you leave tomorrow  were you going to say goodbye   but you don't know when that will be   i wish you good fortune   why   i don't   that's what i am  your weakness   i believe it   i do too   i want to see you  please,2,7,82
22,nymeria,  you can't have them all  it's not fair   the mountain killed father  he'll crush you with one hand,2,7,18

24,oleanna,  then how do you mean to take the iron throne  by asking nicely,2,7,13
25,olenna,  that's very nice to hear  of course i can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter  the common people loved her the nobles loved her  and what is left of her now  ashes  commoners nobles they're all just children really  they won't obey you unless they fear you   so your master plan is to use our armies  forgive me for asking but why did you bother to bring your own   peace  do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his  peace never lasts my dear  would you take a bit of advice from an old woman   he's a clever man your hand  i've known a great many clever men  i've outlived them all  do you know why  i ignored them  the lords of westeros are sheep  are you a sheep  no  you're a dragon  be a dragon,2,7,147
26,qyburn,  we are currently at work on a solution my lord   have you ever been down here your grace   curious that king robert did not have them destroyed   balerion the dread  the beast that aegon rode across the sea  its flames forged the iron throne and brought the seven kingdoms to heel  powerful but not invincible   apparently one of daenarys' dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of meereen  if they can be wounded they can be killed   the finest artilleters and blacksmiths in king's landing have been laboring day and night your grace  if you'd kindly pull that lever,2,7,101
27,randyll,  she has three full-grown dragons your grace  the same as aegon when he conquered the seven kingdoms  how do you propose to stop them   ser jaime  i believe you know my son   if my queen summons me i answer the call  and i've heard what she does to those that defy her   i have an army to mobilize  it won't be long until the fighting starts   it's a long ride back to the reach ser jaime  how may i serve   including olenna tyrell  i'm a tarley  that name means something  we're not oath breakers  we're not schemers  we don't stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings   i swore an oath to house tyrell   i've known olenna since i was a child,2,7,126
28,robett glover,  we called your brother king and then he rode south and lost his kingdom,2,7,14
29,samwell, pardon archmaester  i met stannis baratheon's daughter at castle black  she had greyscale as a baby and was cured  isn't there some way --   no   no   should we send word to your family ser   mormont   archmaester i wanted to --   i wanted to ask you --   possibly something a bit more poetic   archmaester if i could just have a moment   i may have found a way to treat ser jorah  there are two recorded cases of advanced greyscale being cured  i found the procedure in the study of rare diseases by archmaester pilos   oh you are   oh   hello   you're jorah mormont  you're the only son of jeor mormont   my name is samwell tarley  i'm a sworn brother of the night's watch training to serve as maester of castle black  i knew your father  i was with him when he died  you're not dying today ser jorah   drink this   rum  drink it all please  i'm afraid this is going to hurt   if you could take off your shirt   if you wouldn't mind bite down hard  i'm sorry but no one knows i'm here  if they hear you screaming then we're both finished   no  no one else will try so i'm the best you've got  have a seat  i'm going to remove the entire layer of infected tissue then apply a medicinal ointment to the --   shh  shhh  again i'm sorry  please try not to scream,2,7,234
30,sansa,"  do you think it's really tyrion  it could be someone trying to lure you into a trap   ""all dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes""  what does that mean   tyrion is not like the other lannisters  he was always kind to me but it's too great a risk  ""the seven kingdoms will bleed as long as cersei sits on the iron throne  join us  together we can end her tyranny""   you're not suggesting jon meet with her   have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather  the mad king invited him to king's landing and roasted him alive   she is here to reclaim the iron throne and the seven kingdoms  the north is one of those seven kingdoms  this isn't an invitation it's a trap   then send an emissary  don't go yourself   you're abandoning your people  your abandoning your home   whose",2,7,140
31,theon,  it's fine   whatever my queen demands,2,7,6
32,tyene,  momma will want cersei for herself  father got careless  that's what momma says   maybe i'll kill you both before we take king's landing and then i won't have to share,2,7,30
33,tyrion, on a night like this you came into the world  we won't stay on dragonstone for long  conquering westeros would be easy for you but you're not here to be queen of the ashes  we can take the seven kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse if the great houses support your claim against cersei the game is won with the tyrell army and the dornish on our side we have powerful allies in the south  your grace when i was ready to drink myself into a small coffin lord varys told me about a queen in the east who--  lord varys has proven himself a loyal servant   doesn't really roll off the tongue does it   jon snow  ned stark's bastard   i traveled with him to the wall when he joined the night's watch   i can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames but i like jon snow and i trusted him and i am an excellent judge of character   if he does rule the north he would make a valuable ally  the lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother  jon snow has even more reason to hate cersei than you do   if we turn the dragons loose tens of thousands will die in the firestorms     i know how you wage war  we don't poison little girls here  myrcella was innocent   but we won't use dothraki and unsullied   cersei will try to rally the lords of westeros by appealing to their loyalty their love for their country  if we besiege the city with foreigners we prove her point  our army should be westerosi   you are   lady greyjoy will escort you home to sunspear and her iron fleet will ferry the dornish army back up to king's landing   the dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the tyrell army  two great kingdoms united against cersei   the unsullied will have another objective  for decades house lannister has been the true power in westeros  and the seat of that power is casterly rock  grey worm and the unsullied will sail for the rock and take it,2,7,348
34,varys, i remember that storm all the dogs in king's landing howled through the night  cersei controls fewer than half the seven kingdoms the lord of westeros despise her even before your arrival they plotted against her now  they joined our side my queen because they believe in you  i did  i had a choice your grace--serve robert baratheon or face the headman's axe  robert was an improvement on your father to be sure there have been few rulers in history as cruel as the mad king robert was neither mad nor cruel he simply had no interest in being king  until your marriage to khal drogo your grace i knew nothing about you save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful  which you turned to your advantage  king robert  your grace i did what had to be done to--  the kind the realm needs incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty as long as i have my eyes i'll use them i wasn't born into a great house i came from nothing i was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering when i was a child i lived in alleys gutters abandoned houses you wish to know where my true loyalties lie not with any king or queen but with the people the people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule the people whose hearts you aim to win if you demand blind allegiance i respect your wishes grey worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me but if you let me live i will serve you well i will dedicate myself to seeing you on the iron throne because i choose you because i know the people have no better chance than you  i swear it my queen  i would expect nothing less from the mother of dragons   she once served another who wanted the iron throne  it didn't end well for stannis baratheon did it   and why do you think the lord of light singled out this jon snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames that is,2,7,353
35,wolkan,  a raven my king from the citadel,2,7,7
36,yara,  if you want the iron throne take it  we have an army a fleet and three dragons  we should hit king's landing now  hard  with everything we have  the city will fall within a day   you have mine   a few times  never stayed long   a boy a girl  depends on the port   i thought it wasn't for you   he's not your servant   once i kill my uncle   he'll be my advisor my protector   he might have to intervene   until they've made their intentions known   stay here   euron   your mother is below deck  keep her safe,2,7,95
37,yohn royce,  your grace with respect i must agree with lady sansa  i remember the mad king all too well  a targaryen cannot be trusted nor can a lannister,2,7,27
1,bran,  hello sansa   yes  i need to speak to him   i can never be the lord of winterfell  i can never be lord of anything  i'm the three-eyed raven   it's difficult to explain   it means i can see everything  everything that's ever happened to everyone  everything that's happening right now  it's all pieces fragments  i need to learn to see better  when the long night comes again i need to be ready   the three-eyed raven taught me   i told you it's difficult to explain   i'm sorry for all that's happened to you  i'm sorry it had to happen here at our home  it was so beautiful that night  snow falling just like now  and you were so beautiful in your white wedding dress   i'll stay a bit longer,3,7,127
2,cersei,  you've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown   and you deserve a proper reward for your heroism   you shall have what your heart desires --   with euron greyjoy commanding our naval forces and jaime lannister leading our armies the sons and daugters of westeros shall defend our country   i want you to know i understand  even though we're enemies you and i i understand the fear that drives you  i was there that day when ser gregor crushed your lover's head  i close my eyes i can hear the sound of oberyn's skull breaking   the sound of your scream  i never heard a sound like that  i thought that's true love  oberyn looked beautiful that day  he really did  no one moved like him  no one had such skill with a spear  even ser gregor couldn't stop him  if only he hadn't taunted him  he could have walked away and left poor ser gregor to die  but that wasn't your lover's way was it  now he's burried somewhere  and here ser gregor is stronger than ever  that must be difficult for you  when my daughter was taken from me my only daughter well you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child  i fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse  i couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms  i never got to have a mother  but myrcella did  she was mine and you took her from me  why did you do that   it doesn't matter now   your daughter is a beauty too  brown eyes those lips  a perfect dornish beauty   i imagine she is your favorite   i know i know we're not supposed to have favorites  but still we're only human  we love who we love   i'm sorry  i can't understand you  the gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying  it must be frustrating   we all make our choices  you chose to murder my daughter  you must have felt powerful after you made that choice   do you feel powerful now  i don't sleep very well not at all really  i lie in bed and i stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies  how to destroy ellaria sand the woman who murdered my only daughter  i thought about having ser gregor crush your skull the way he did oberyn's  it would be poetic i suppose but fast  too fast   i thought about having him crush your daughter's skull   she's so beautiful  the thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg no it's just not right   qyburn he's the cleverest man i know  clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder myrcella  the long goodbye was that it   that's the one   how long does the poison take   but death is certain   your daughter will die here in this cell  you will be here watching when she does  you will be here the rest of your days  if you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat  you will live to watch your daughter rot to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you've made   make sure the guards change the torches every few hours  i don't want her to miss a thing   i am queen of the seven kingdoms  i'll do as i please   good  and we'll need fresh sheets for the bed   the iron bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences   the destruction of the sept of baelor was a tragic accident   the iron bank wants its gold back   and we both know gold wins wars  your vaults are empty  your late husband's profligacy saw to that   and the iron bank wants to bet on a winner   that's a fancy way of saying bet  the war has already begun  i've drawn first blood  i decapitated the dornish snake  my armada owns the narrow sea   euron greyjoy is loyal to me   her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think  now let's talk about the targaryen girl  you want to invest in her  i'm guessing the iron bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade  how are you profits now that daenerys has freed all the slaves   from what i gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch  in your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries   the lannisters owe the iron bank quite a lot of money but lannisters always pay their debts  do former slaves or dothraki or dragons   give me a fortnight  stay in king's landing as my honored guest and when you return to braavos i swear to you my debt will be paid in full,3,7,799
3,daenerys,  thank you for traveling so far my lords  i hope the seas weren't too rough   forgive me --   forever  so i assume my lord that you're here to bend the knee   oh  well that is unfortunate  you've travelled all this way to break faith with house targaryen   my father was an evil man  on behalf of house targaryen i ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family  and i ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father  our two houses were allies for centuries  those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known  centuries of peace and prosperity with the targaryens sitting on the iron throne and a stark serving as warden of the north  i am the last targaryen jon snow  honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine  bend the knee and i will name you warden of the north  together we will save this country from those who would destroy it   then why are you here   did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived   and did you see the dothraki all of whom have sworn to kill for me   but still i need your help   still that doesn't explain why i need your help   you told me you liked this man   in the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child   as far as i can see you are the enemy to the north   the dead   is that another figure of speech   i was born at dragonstone  not that i can remember it   we fled before robert's assassins could find us  robert was your father's best friend no  i wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib  not that it matters now of course  i spent my life in foreign lands  so many men have tried to kill me  i don't remember all of their names  i have been sold like a brood mare  i have been chained and betrayed raped and defiled  do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile  faith  not in any gods  not in myths and legends  in myself  in daenerys targaryen  the world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born  the dothraki hadn't crossed the sea  any sea   they did for me  i was born to rule the seven kingdoms  and i will   that's fair  it's also fair to point out that i'm the rightful queen of the seven kingdoms  by declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom you are in open rebellion   you must forgive my manners  you will both be tired after your long journey  we'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms   not yet   and   all of them   dragonglass   why are we talking about glass  we just lost two of our allies   and what does the king in the north want with dragonglass   and what do you think of this army of the dead and white walkers and night kings   which wise man said this   are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom   what was that ser davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people  did you notice that   i named them for my brothers vicerys and rhaegon they're both gone now   you lost two brothers as well   people thought dragons were gone forever but here they are  perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know   he is my hand   we all enjoy what we're good at   you know i'm not going to let cersei stay on the iron throne   and i haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne   i will allow you to mine the dragonglass and forge weapons from it  any resources or men you need i will provide for you   you better get to work jon snow   we need to find euron greyjoy's fleet and sink it   i'm not talking about sending our ships after him   i wouldn't be alone  i'd have drogon vicerion and rhaegal  what can anyone do to them   what about casterly rock,3,7,702
4,daerneys,  forgive me ser davos  i never did receive a formal education but i could have sworn the last king in the north was torren stark who bent the knee to my ancestor aegon targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen  torren stark swore fealty to house targaryen in perpetuity  but do i have my facts wrong,3,7,61
5,davos,  davos seaworth   unluckily for me   where are you from  i can't place the accent   ah  i hear it's beautiful down there  palm trees and butterflies  i haven't been myself   this place has changed   this is jon snow   he's king in the north   apologies  i have a flea bottom accent i know  but jon snow is king in the north your grace  he's not a lord   i wasn't there your grace   not to defeat cersei  you could storm king's landing tomorrow and the city would fall  hell we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons   you don't believe him  i understand that  it sounds like nonsense   but if destiny has brough daenerys targaryen back to our shores it has also made jon snow king in the north  you were the first to bring dothraki to westeros  he was the first to make allies with wildlings and northmen  he was named lord commander of the night's watch  he was named king in the north  not because of his birthright  he has no birthright  he's a damn bastard  all those hard son's of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him   all those things you don't believe in he faced those things  he fought those things for the good of his people  he risked his life for his people  he took a knife in the heart for his people  he gave his own --   if we don't put asside our enmities and band together we will die  and then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the iron throne,3,7,261
6,euron,  this is the life  look at them  cheering for a greyjoy   i have to be honest it's making me hard  did you see little theon's face right before he jumped overboard   oh no   what a twat   my queen  please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the iron islands   i give you --   a bit more than a true friend   there's only one reward i want   there's nothing quite like it is there  the love of the people  i suppose you wouldn't know   or yours  they just like severed heads really  listen if you have any advice at all i'd love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers   does she like it gentle or rough  a finger in the bum   shhh shhh shhh not now  we'll talk later,3,7,140
7,grey worm,  there are supposed to be more than this  many more   where are they  where are the rest of the lannisters,3,7,20
8,guard,  lady sansa at the gate,3,7,5
9,jaime,  this same mob spat at my sister not long ago and if you turn on us they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike   advice   no   don't   what are you doing  no one can see us like this    it is   i suppose as well as can be expected   the truth is casterly rock isn't worth much anymore  well it is to me  my fond childhood memories won't keep cersei on the throne   for now  they won't be able to hold it  euron greyjoy's navy burned their ships we emptied the larders before we left  eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across westeros   as robb stark did to me at whispering wood  there are always lessons in failures   my father always said i was a slow learner   widow's wail   to you sure  to others as well  but after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us the people living peaceful in the world she built do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it   possibly  not much to be gained from discussing it with you though is there   yes it has   i think we're done here   cersei had several ideas  whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the red keep  flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of king's landing  i talked her out of those   no  i made sure of that,3,7,243
10,jon,  the dwarf of casterly rock   you were pissing off the edge if i remember right  you picked up some scars along the road   of course   she is   i didn't ask --   she's starting to let on   as long as you tell me how a lannister became hand to daenerys targaryen   my bannermen think i'm a fool for coming here   true  but i'm not a stark   the winds were kind your grace   i am not   break faith  your father burned my grandfather alive  he burned my uncle alive  he would have burned the seven kingdoms   you're right  you're not guilty of your father's crime  and i'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows   because i need your help and you need mine   i did   they're hard to miss   but you haven't stormed king's landing  why not  the only reason i can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people  it's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it  which means at the very least you're better than cersei   because right now you and i and cersei and everyone else we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair   your grace everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north   i am not your enemy  the dead are the enemy   the army of the dead is on the march   you don't know me well my lord but do you think i am a liar or a madman   the army of the dead is real  the white walkers are real  the knight king is real  i've seen them  if they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --   you'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the night king   there's no time for that  there's no time for any of this  while we stand here debating --   and why would i do that   i mean no offense your grace but i don't know you  as far as i can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name  and my own father fought to overthrow the mad king  the lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them  and i will continue to do so as well as i can   am i your prisoner   i'm a prisoner on this island   except to my ship  they took my ship   i'm not playing word games with you  the dead are coming for us all   it's hard for me to fathom  it really is  if someone told me about the white walkers and the night king --   you probably don't believe me   you didn't before  grumpkins and snarks you called them  do you remember  you said it was all nonsense   how do i convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all   i know it's a good question  i'm looking for an answer   i need to help prepare my people for what's coming  i can't help them from here  i'd like to leave   everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes  don't go south  don't answer a summons from the mad king's daughter a foreign invader  and here i am  a northern fool   what do you mean   amazing thing to see   you've been talking to tyrion   he enjoys talking   i don't   i never expected that you would   i haven't either   thank you   so you believe me then about the night king and the army of the dead,3,7,590
11,jorah,  a bit  less than before   i don't know anything about that  i just started feeling better  i assumed it was the rest that did it   and the climate   how bad is it   i surrendered to this sickness the moment i first saw it  i knew it would kill me or i'd kill myself before it could  daenerys stormborn convinced me otherwise  the only place for me is with her   i owe my life to her and you   perhaps our paths will cross again,3,7,83
12,little finger,  command suits you  the northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall   i know cersei better than anyone here  if you turn your back on her --   i only meant to say --   one of two things will happen  either the dead will defeat the living in which case all our troubles come to an end  or life will win out  and what then   don't fight in the north or the south  fight every battle everywhere always in your mind  everyone is your enemy everyone is your friend every possible series of events is happening all at once  live that way and nothing will surprise you  everything that happens will be something that you've seen before,3,7,120
13,man,  draw  loose,3,7,2
14,marwyn,  hmm   hmm  does it hurt   the infection no longer appears to be active   unusual  unlikely  one could almost be forgiven for thinking the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of ointment   the climate  you're free to go ser  this chamber is needed for the infectious which you are no longer   tarley i'd like to speak with you in my study this evening   you treated him   who told you to treat him   who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him   but you treated him anyway   i forbade it because it's dangerous and rarely successful  especially on someone of that age  you could have infected yourself and others  you could have devastated the entire citadel  but you didn't  it's a meticulous difficult procedure  many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed  but you succeeded  how   that man is alive because of you  you should be proud   come here   all these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away  i need you to make copies of them   you were expecting a reward  your reward is not being immediately expelled from the citadel  you'd better get started  be mindful of the paper mites  they like flesh as well,3,7,210
15,melisandre,  i've done my part  i've brought ice and fire together   my time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end   neither of us is common folk anymore  i did not part on good terms with the king in the north or his advisor   because of mistakes i made  terrible mistakes  i would only be a distraction if i stayed   volantis   i will return dear spider  one last time   i have to die in this strange country just like you,3,7,82
16,messenger,  forgive me your grace  the visitor from braavos has arrived   at once your grace,3,7,14
17,missandei,  welcome to dragonstone  our queen knows this is a long journey  she appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf  if you wouldn't mind handing over your weapons   please this way   i was born on the island of naarth   you stand in the presence of daenerys stormborn of house targaryen rightful heir to the iron throne rightful queen of the andals and the first men protector of the seven kingdoms the mother of dragons the khaleesi of the great grass sea the unburnt the breaker of chains   they can still do something to you  it only takes one arrow   and what will they face,3,7,105
18,olenna,  it's done   and now the rains weep for our whores  did we fight well   it was never our forte  golden roses indeed  your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending casterly rock   so you'll just let them take it   and you took your army your real army and went where they weren't   yes  you must be very wise by now   if he was so clever why didn't he take highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry  i suppose i'll be able to ask him myself soon enough  no more learning from my mistakes eh  how will you do it  with that sword   that was joffrey's sword wasn't it  not that he ever used it  what did he call it   he really was a cunt wasn't he  i did unspeakable things to protect my family or watched them being done on my orders  i never lost a night's sleep over them  they were necessary  and whatever i imagined necessary for the safety of house tyrell i did  but your sister has done things i wasn't capable of imagining  that was my prize mistake a failure of imagination  she's a monster you do know that   you love her  you really do love her  you poor fool  she'll be the end of you   what better person to discuss it with  what better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room  but perhaps you're right  if she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control   she's a disease  i regret my role in spreading it  you will too   how will it happen   will there be pain   that's good   i'd hate to die like your son clawing at my neck foam and bile spilling from my mouth eyes blood red skin purple  it must have been horrible for you as a kingsguard as a father  it was horrible enough for me  a shocking scene  not at all what i intended  you see i'd never seen the posion work before  tell cersei  i want her to know it was me,3,7,345
19,qyburn,  the long farewell   difficult to say  hours days it depends on the subject's constitution   oh yes your grace quite certain,3,7,20
20,samwell,  i suppose i'll find out this evening   where will you go   your father saved me more than once  it's the least i could do   i hope they do   yes   no one   i seem to remember you   i did   i read the books and followed the instructions   thank you archmaester,3,7,49
21,sansa,  how much do we have   what does that mean   what's the longest winter in the past 100 years   you're telling me we don't have enough food especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend winterfell   we must prepare for that eventuality  every direction the threat comes from this is the best place to be  we need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north  if we don't use it by winter's end we'll give it back to them but if the entire north has to flee to winterfell there won't be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them   maester wolkan you'll see to it   are they covering those breastplates in leather   well shouldn't they be once the real cold comes   so they should be   you don't know cersei better than anyone here   that the woman who murdered my mother father and brother is dangerous  thank you for your wise council   i wish jon was here   your father's last living true born son  you're lord of winterfell   i don't know what that means   try please for me   how do you know all of this   i thought you were the three-eyed raven   bran --   i have to go back inside bran,3,7,213
22,theon,  euron has her   i couldn't save her  i tried,3,7,9
23,tycho,  no thank you   my condolences your grace on the death of your son  from all reports he was a fine young man   condolences and congratulations  you've become the first ruling queen in the seven kingdoms  that's quite an accomplishment  the iron bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law   indeed  but sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership   your father never minced words either  but yes your debts are considerable  and you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts  we both know how expensive war can be   your wealthiest ally is the tyrells who are now your enemies  you're surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne   we don't make bets  we invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful   euron greyjoy's armada owns the narrow sea   for now  daenerys targaryen has three full grown dragons  how well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons   the slave trade has entered a down turn it's true   your father's daughter indeed,3,7,182
24,tyene,  momma,3,7,1
25,tyrion,"  the bastard of winterfell   i believe we last saw each other on top of the wall   it's been a long road  but we're both still here   i'm tyrion lannister   ah the onion knight  we fought on opposite sides at the battle of blackwater bay   missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor   and sansa i hear she's alive and well   does she miss me terribly   a sham marriage and unconsummated   well it was  it wasn't  anyway she's much smarter than she lets on   good  at some point i want to hear how a knight's watch recruit became king in the north   a long and bloody tale  to be honest i was drunk for most of it   of course they do  if i was your hand i would have advised against it  general rule of thumb stark men don't fare well when they travel south   i'd say you get used to them but you never really do   come  their mother is waiting for you   your grace this is ser davos seaworth   forever   almost   i do   i believe he's calling all of us children  figure of speech   the army of the dead   no i don't think you're either of those things   the war against my sister has already begun  you can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting --   if it doesn't matter you might as well kneel   swear your allegiance to queen daenerys  help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north   it takes no time to bend the knee  pledge your sword to her cause   i came out here to brood over my failure to predict the greyjoy attack  you're making it difficult  you look a lot better brooding than i do  you make me feel like i'm failing at brooding over failing   i wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island  you're free to walk the castle the beaches to go wherever you want   i wouldn't say we took your ship   why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies and i'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men   i do actually   it was all nonsense  everybody knew it  but then mormont saw them and you saw them and i trust the eyes of an honest man more than i trust what everybody knows   good question   people's minds aren't made for problems that large  white walkers the night king army of the dead it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister   it seems unlikely that you became king in the north by giving up that easily   children are not their fathers luckily for all of us  and sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye  daenerys could have sailed for westeros long ago but she didn't  instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now  while you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the mad king's daughter  she protects people from monsters just as you do  that's why she came here  and she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting  that's not a reasonable thing to ask   so do you have anything reasonable to ask   maybe you are a northern fool  i'm asking if there's something i can do to help you   yes  volcanic glass obsidian  he says you have a tremendous amount of it here   which is why i was speaking to jon snow a potential ally   apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill white walkers and their foot soldiers or stop them destroy them  i'm unsure of the nomenclature   i'd very much like to believe that jon snow is wrong but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it   i don't remember   i would never do thatto you  the reason i believe jon snow is because he's here  all of his advisors would have told him not to come  i would have told him not to come yet he's here anyway  you don't have to believe him  let him mine the dragonglass  if he's wrong it's worthless  you didn't even know it was here  it's nothing to you  give him something by giving him nothing  take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally  keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand  casterly rock   you must allow them their flights of fancy  it's dreary in the north   but you'll have to go yourself  euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place  you'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long   it's too great a risk  you're too important   yes  cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy house lannister  she will be ready   no one has ever taken the rock   the lannister army is still the army my father built  well trained and well provisioned  10000 men at least  they will see us coming   they will be ready   the gates of casterly rock are impregnable   the fight up the walls will be hard  we'll be at a disadvantage  many men will die   interesting thing about my father  he built our house up from near ruin  he built our army  he built casterly rock as we know it but he didn't build the sewers  that was beneath him  so he gave the job to the lowest person he could find  me  he was right  i was low  the company i kept low women mostly  they weren't welcome at the rock  father disapproved of that sort of behavior  i couldn't walk them through the front gates  i couldn't have them in my chambers  so in the process of building the sewers i threw in something for myself   it was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers   no better place for low pursuits  casterly rock the impregnable fortress   as a good friend of mine once said ""give me 10 good men and i'll impregnate the bitch""   and so it begins  they will face the bulk of the lannister forces  they will be outnumbered  they will have less armor and fewer weapons   but as my sister's armies fights for her the unsullied will be fighting for something greater  they will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them  they will be fighting for you  and that is why they will triump",3,7,1115
26,unsullied 1,  there are none left,3,7,4
27,varys,  i wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests  you begged us to summon the king in the north  don't you want to see him again   strange  you spoke so highly of jon snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff  i didn't take you for a bashful girl   oh i doubt that  give us common folk one taste of power we're like the lion who tasted man  nothing is ever so sweet again   why   so where will you go   good  if you don't mind my saying i don't think you should return to westeros  i'm not sure you'd be safe here   my lady --   our iron born and dornish allies were attacked on route to dorne   two or three ships escaped  the rest sunk our captured  ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured  the greyjoys are dead or captured   your grace he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet  to send our remaining ships after him --   the unsullied will be there soon   a difficult situation  they know we're coming,3,7,176
28,wolkan,  4000 bushels my lady   i'm not entirely certain  i'll check maester llewyn's records  he kept a copy of every raven scroll   no my lady most likely not,3,7,27
29,yohn,  for the current occupants of the castle it's enough food for a year perhaps more   very wise my lady   no my lady   they should indeed  pardon me my lady   you there why isn't there leather on these,3,7,37

1,arya,  in there  i live here   i'm arya stark  this is my home   send for maester llewyn or ser rodrick  they'll tell you who i am   go ask jon snow then the king in the north  he's my brother   if jon snow is gone who is in charge of winterfell   which lady stark   tell sansa her sister is home   i'm getting into this castle one way or another  if i'm not who i say i am i won't last long  but if i am and sansa finds out that you turned me away   do i have to call you lady stark now   i didn't run  you need better guards   it suits you lady stark  jon left you in charge   that doesn't look like him  it should have been carved by someone who knew his face   we're not   they say you killed joffrey  did you   me too  i was angry when i heard someone else had done it  however long my list got he was always first   of people i'm going to kill   it's a long story  i imagine yours is too   mine neither but our stories aren't over yet   you saw me   so did i   most of them are dead already   where did you get this   littlefinger he's here   why would a cutthroat have a valyrian steel dagger   are you sure  it's valyrian steel   don't fight someone like her in the first place   it's been awhile since i've trained   he didn't beat the hound  you did  i want to train with you   you swore to serve both of my mother's daughters didn't you   i won't cut you  don't worry   no one,4,7,270
2,bran,  do you know who this belonged to   chaos is a ladder   i'm not lord stark   maester wolkan built it for me so i can move around more easily   you're leaving   no i don't   thank you   for helping me   i'm not really not anymore  i remember what it felt like to be brandon stark but i remember so much else now   you came home   i saw you at the crossroads   i see quite a lot now   i thought you might go to king's landing   cersei is on her list of names   littlefinger gave it to me   he thought i'd want it   because it was meant to kill me   someone very wealthy wanted me dead   it doesn't matter   i don't want it   it's wasted on a cripple,4,7,125
3,brienne,  i did next to nothing   i'm not a --   thank you podrick   don't lunge   don't go where your enemy leads you   up   and don't --   nice sword  very nice dagger   i can go and find the master of arms for you my lady   move aside podrick   you can't use that my lady  it's too small   i'll try not to   who taught you to do that,4,7,65
4,bronn,  you just won the biggest prize in the world  what could you possibly have to be upset about  come on  you can tell me  queen of thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye   there is no more high septon   there is still the question of my prize   it's not a castle   how about that one  it's available   i beg to differ   oh is that why you're so fucking glum eh  all your new riches weighing you down   right  just not to me   yes i'm sure queen cersei's reign will be quiet and peaceful   like what   i'm not much for shoveling weight   come on  your father's not here   men shit themselves when they die  didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school   well i learned it when i was 5   listen   in line now   get back to king's landing   you're a commander not a damned infantryman  these fuckers are about to swamp us   go get it then   where are you   come on you fucker,4,7,169
5,cersei,  you're too kind my lord   is on its way  my brother is supervising its transportation himself   we must devise a way to raise their spirits   my only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it   it will indeed  i need to expand my armies my navies  my hand qyburn had made overtures to the golden company in essos   that's good to hear  i too would like them to recover some things that belong to me,4,7,82
6,cut to  ext winterfell,  ext winterfell,4,7,2
7,daenerys,  soon  they will come back to me   what happened   many things   it's all right   when   they were right here standing where we're standing before there were targaryens or starks or lannisters  maybe even before there were men   doing what  fighting each other   they fought together against their common enemy  despite their differences despite their suspicions together  we need to do the same if we're going to survive   and you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons   i will fight for you  i will fight for the northwhen you bend the knee   they will if their king does  they chose you to lead them  they chose you to protect them  isn't their survival more important than your pride   what is it   that's very good to hear   isn't it   you will stay  all my allies are gone  they've been taken from me while i've been sitting here on this island   who won't be able to eat because cersei has taken all the food from the reach   the right plan  your strategy has lost us dorne the iron islands and the reach   our enemies  your family you mean  perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all   enough with the clever plans   i have three large dragons  i'm going to fly them to the red keep   my enemies are in the red keep  what kind of a queen am i if i'm not willing to risk my life to fight them   what do you think i should do   i'm at war  i'm losing   what do you think i should do   dracarys   dracarys,4,7,263
8,davos,  you'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves  perhaps --   what do you think of her   i believe you know of whom i speak   a good heart  i've noticed you starring at that good heart   fewer   speaking of good hearts missandei of naarth   king snow isn't it  no  that doesn't sound right  king jon   is the custom different in naarth   the sounds liberating   if i may how did a slave girl come to advise daenerys targaryen   that was good of her  of course you're serving her now aren't you   you'll forgive me if i switch sides   we heard your uncle attacked your fleet  we thought you were dead   your sister,4,7,109
9,dickon,  we have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the reach   my lord   ser jaime   dickon   it was glorious   all my life we've been pledged to house tyrell  i knew some of those men  i hunted with them   i didn't expect it to smell like that,4,7,48
10,guard,  your people can't fight,4,7,4
11,jaime,  halt that wagon   i'll save my confessions for the high septon   no there isn't is there   that's a lot of money i just gave you   you don't want highgarden   we're at war  daenerys targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in  besides think of the upkeep  the more you own the more it weighs you down   they're not mine  the gold belongs to the iron bank  we pay our debts   bronn of the blackwater formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid  when we win this war all the castles in the seven kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you   stranger things have happened   the current harvest   ser bronn will you accompany the tarleys and help them accelerate this process   no but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest i've heard you guys have a real talent for that   good   we are stretched a bit thin   let's give them fair warning first  these men fought well at highgarden   rickon   i hear you fought bravely at highgarden  your first battle   and   they didn't deserve to die  but lady olenna chose to betray the queen and support the targaryen girl  so here we are   what   spears and shields  spears and shields   spears and shields   i'm not abandoning my army   we can hold them off   hold the line   archers  archers with me   knock   loose   qyburn's scorpion is over there   i can't shoot with one hand   come on   take cover   come on boy  come on,4,7,267
12,jon,  your grace   i wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits   so this is it all we'll ever need   there is something else i want to show your your grace   the children of the forest made these   a very long time ago   no   they were here together the children and the first men   because the enemy is real  it's always been real   no i don't think i can   my people won't accept a southern ruler not after everything they've suffered   i would never presume to --   i never thought that dragons would exist again  no one did  the people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen  maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen  build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known   but if you use them to melt castles and burn cities you're not different  you're just more of the same   who   i think she has a good heart   there's no time for that  i saw the night king davos  i looked into his eyes  how many men do we have in the north to fight him  10000  less   what   it doesn't matter   of course   i'm a bastard  my mother and father weren't married   why did you leave your homeland   i'm sorry   and if you wanted to sail home to naarth tomorrow --   you believe that   is that a greyjoy ship   what you did for her is the only reason i'm not killing you   the queen is gone,4,7,255
13,little finger,  this is for you   the last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat but your mother fought him off   the other dagger the one that took her life i would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if i could have  i wasn't there for her when she needed me most  but i am here for her now  to do what she would have done to protect her children  anything i can do for you brandon you need only ask   no  that very question was what started the war of the five kings  in a way that dagger made you what you are today  forced from your home driven out to the wilds beyond the wall  i imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe   to go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world i can only imagine --   i'm sorry to have disturbed you lord stark,4,7,161
14,man 1,  hey oh  where are you going   fuck off   arya stark is dead   maester's name is wolkan   he's a thousand miles away   mm-hmm   you tell us  you're the one impersonating her sister   lady sansa is too busy to waster her breath on you just like us  so for the last time fuck off   you tell her   because if you don't i'll hit you right in the fucking face as hard as i can   when we turned around she had gone my lady  she was nothing  some winter town girl   don't trouble yourself over it my lady  we'll find her,4,7,98
15,man 2,  there's no rodrick here   it's cold  we're busy  so you know best fuck off   the lady of winterfell lady stark   you sit there  right there  don't move   go tell lady stark  i'll watch her   i'm not   we told her to wait  we were standing right next to her   she comes in asking for ser rodrick and maester llewyn,4,7,58
16,meera,  what's that   it's a very good idea   i don't want to leave you but when they come i need to be with my family  and you're safe safe as anyone can be now  you don't need me anymore   that's all you've got to say   thank you   my brother died for you  hodor and summer died for you  i almost died for you  bran   you died in that cave,4,7,68
17,missandei,  your grace there's still no word from the unsullied   he better   many things   ser davos lord snow   forgive me but may i ask a question   your name is jon snow but your father's name was ned stark   we don't have marriage in naarth so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist   i was stolen away by slavers   she bought me from my master and set me free   i serve my queen because i want to serve my queen  because i believe in her   then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune   i know it  all of us who came with her from essos we believe in her  she's not our queen because she's the daughter of some king we never knew  she's the queen we chose,4,7,130
18,podrick,  catelyn stark would be proud  you kept your vow   you're too hard on yourself my lady,4,7,16
19,randyll,  the granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons my lord   my lord   all of the gold is safely through the gates of king's landing   we need to get the last of these wagons over the blackwater rush before nightfall  if the head of the line is ambushed the tail will never be able to reinforce in time   with your permission flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility   come on lads  not those wagons  fall in line  fall in line   spears armed,4,7,83
20,sansa,  you don't have to  i know where she is   yes   you shouldn't have run from the guards   he did  i hope he comes back soon  i remember how happy he was to see me  when he sees you his heart will probably stop   everyone who knew his face is dead   i wish i had   your list   how did you get back to winterfell   yes  it's not a very pleasant one   no they're not   arya bran's home too   bran has visions   why would you go back there   who else is on your list   he's declared for house stark   why would he give you a dagger   why   the cutthroat after your fall   he's not a generous man  he wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back   what do you mean it doesn't matter   if they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then i'm afraid they'll have to make due with --,4,7,157
21,theon,  jon  i didn't know you were here   sansa is she all right   i should be   euron has her  i came to ask the queen to help get her back   where did she go,4,7,33
22,tycho,  i must say i don't think the iron bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment  i always considered your father a very effective and efficient man but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely   i am neither kind nor a lord your grace  i am merely an instrument of the institution i represent its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic not sentiment  and the current arithmetic is outstanding  the gold --   some at the iron bank will be disappointed  they've grown rather fond of your interest payments   yes  perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture   i see a great deal of potential in that venture  i imagine that it would require outside investment   i know them well  they've helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears   rest assured your grace you can count on the iron bank's support as soon as the gold arrives,4,7,160
23,tyrion,  we took casterly rock   we still have the largest army   call grey worm and the unsullied back  we still have enough ships to carry the dothraki to the mainland  commit to the blockade of king's landing  we have a plan  it's still the right plan   if i've underestimated our enemies --   we've discussed this   a smart one   flee you idiot   you fucking idiot,4,7,63
0,1,  i put very little stock in it myself  prophecies of doom are never in short supply especially when winter comes   the north has dulled many good maester's wits  i'm not sure if it's the cold the drink or the company   a crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes   perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind   that does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples   don't forget the prophet lodock that promised the drowned god would rise up and destroy aegon the conquerer   is he the one whose father and brother were just burned alive,5,7,118
1,2,  it brings to mind the work of davy moonstone the charlatan who claimed to see the children of the forest   horrible business,5,7,22
2,arya,  he didn't  he trusted you to hold it for him   these are mother and father's chambers   nothing   what   you always liked nice things  it made you feel better than everyone   they were insulting jon and you sat there and listened   their opinions are important to you   not if they lose their heads first   and if jon doesn't come back you'll need their support so you can work together to give you what you really want   you're thinking it right now  you don't want to be but the thought just won't go away   my lady,5,7,94
3,beric,  we don't want to go beyond the wall we have to  our lord told us the great war is coming   here we all are at the edge of the world at the same moment heading in the same direction for the same reason   it doesn't matter what we think our reasons are   there's a greater purpose at work and we serve it together whether we know it or not  we may take the steps but the lord of light --,5,7,80

5,bronn,  what the fuck were you doing back there   you saw the dragon between you and her   and   listen to me cunt  till i get what i'm owed a dragon doesn't get to kill you  you don't get to kill you  only i get to kill you   you're fucked   no i do not  dragons are where our partnership ends  i'm not going to be around when those things start spitting fire on king's landing   best well jump back in that river   all the more reason for you to train  unless you plan on fighting dothraki 12 year olds   and here i am ready to train   i don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet   oh you won't be swinging it at me   i'll leave you to it,5,7,132
6,cersei,  how many men did we lose   it's armies that win wars  we have the tyrell gold we have the iron bank behind us  we can buy mercenaries   they're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid which they will be   so what do we do  sue for peace  i sit on her father's throne the father you betrayed and murdered  and in her mind she's winning  what sort of offer do you think she'd make   maybe we can count on tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son   you saw the crossbow you saw his body   after all this time it still amazes me --   and this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her   and you believed her   i shouldn't have listened to you  she should have died screaming   so we fight and die or we submit and die  i know my choice  a soldier should know his   that won't be necessary   he's hand of the queen  why are you here   what did our brother have to say   to discuss a surrender   she just won a great victory  why would she want a truce now   are you going to punish him   bronn   he betrayed you  he set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent  do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing   i've come to believe that accomodation with the dragon queen could be in our immediate interest  she has the numbers  if we want to beat her we have to be clever  we have to fight her like father would have  dead men dragons and dragon queens whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house  for this   you   do you remember what father used to say about people   never betray me again,5,7,314
7,daenerys,  i know what cersei has told you that i've come to destroy your cities --   step forward my lord   you will not kneel   you will not trade your honor for your life  i respect that   who are you   i meant what i said  i'm not here to put men in chains  if that becomes an option many will take it  i gave them a choice  they made it   i'm not beheading anyone   lord randyll tarley dickon tarley i daenerys of house targaryen first of my name breaker of chains and mother of dragons sentence you to die   dracarys   they're beautiful aren't they   they're not beasts to me  no matter how big they get how terrifying to everyone else they're my children   no   and i have fewer enemies today than i did yesterday   you're not sure how you feel about that   how many men did your army kill taking winterfell back from the boltons   we both want to help people  we can only help them from a position of strength  sometimes strength is terrible  when you first came here ser davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people   so it was a figure of speech   he is my friend   jon snow this is ser jorah mormont an old friend   you look strong  you found a cure   it would be my honor   i'm happy for you  you don't look happy   you said you don't have enough men   and give the country to cersei  as soon as i march away she marches in   i thought that was what we are trying to avoid   and how would you get into king's landing   well it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men   i haven't given you permission to leave   we should be better at saying farewell by now   but i've grown used to him,5,7,310
8,davos,  is that possible   i can smuggle you in but if the goldcloaks were to recognize you i'm warning you i'm not a fighter   they won't follow ser jorah   you can't lead a raid beyond the wall  you're not in the night's watch anymore  you're king in the north   last time i was here you killed my son with wildfire   there's a path to the left that hugs the cliff  the guards hardly ever patrol it  too many steps   i've got my own business in flea bottom   then we're fucked  best hurry   i wasn't sure i'd find you   i thought you might still be rowing   i looked in shops taverns brothels  i should have known to come straight to the street of steel   i haven't been here in years  why should they recognize me  sometimes i hardly do  nothing fucks you harder than time   anybody give you any trouble   don't be so sure  safety is never a permanent state of affairs  bad things are coming   i think you need to understand --   you should know what you're heading into   you might want to bring one of those swords   keep your father's name to yourself  the situation is complicated enough already   i told you clovis if we don't get out of here soon someone is going to --   no weapons friends  i promise  what can i do for you   it is   still five gold dragons   15   i can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you   not more gold   come and have a look   fermented crab   fermented crab  one bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week  a man thinks he's done he's ready to go back to his loving family but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth  five minutes later he's back in the race  here have a taste   i'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a whole in that chainmail   i really wouldn't try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you   perhaps there's some arrangement   this is gendry   we're leaving today  the king's got a lot on his mind   he doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king   you're just clovis a smith who's come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the winterfell forges   begging your pardon your grace   yet again   he was meant to keep that to himself   don't be a fool  you're not a soldier   he can handle himself   as my father used to say it's better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life   yeah  nobody mind me  all i've ever done is live to a ripe old age   i've been failing at that job of late   i'll be staying behind  i'm a liability out there as you well know   our reasons aren't your reasons,5,7,487
9,dickon,  you will have to kill me too   i'm dickon tarley son of randyll tarley   i will not,5,7,17
10,gendry,  weren't you worried about the goldcloaks   here i am arming lannisters  i never get a second look  you were right  safest place for me was right under the queen's nose   you came to get me  you want me to come with you   i'm ready  let's go   don't you think i've been thinking about it every swing of the hammer how happy i am making weapons for the family that killed my father  they tried to kill me   i've been getting ready  i never knew what for but i've always known i'd know it when it comes   i don't know much about swinging swords but this --   who should i say i am   that they are  i try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves   i understand   you don't have to worry   understood   it's gendry your grace  i'm robert baratheon's son  bastard son   our fathers trusted each other  why shouldn't we   i met yours in my shop   you're a lot shorter   all i ever knew was they fought together and won  ser davos told me where you're going your grace and why  let me come with you   no but i'm a fighter  and he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that   i prefer a hammer   i owe you my life  twice over  but if what you said is true about what's out there i can't wait out this war   don't trust them  don't trust any of them   they're the brotherhood  and the last thing their lord told them to do was sell me to a red witch to be murdered   how can we be,5,7,271
11,gilly,"  do you know how many steps there are in the citadel   15782   guess how many windows are in the great sept of baelor   that's true  this high septon meynard he recorded everything  he even recorded his own bowel movements  what does ""annulment"" mean   meynard says here that he issued an anullment for prince rhaegar and remarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in dorne  is that a common thing --   steps  that number was steps   are you sure you want to do this  you always wanted to be a maester",5,7,96
12,guard,  this man says he is your friend khaleesi,5,7,8
13,guard 1,  you there   is that your boat   are you joking   apiece   what's in the boat   mmm   or hams   where did you get that scar,5,7,23
14,guard 2,  the docks are that way   you must be even older than you look  15   wine   i like wine   what   oi dwarf   that dwarf --   we was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that awhile back   arrangement  you gonna arrange to pay us more than queen cersei,5,7,48
15,jaime,  you could have killed me   ending the war by killing her   that was only one of them  she has two more  if she decides to use them to really use them --   don't you mean we're fucked   i have to tell cersei   we haven't done a full counting   i just saw the dothraki fight  they'll beat any mercenary army  they'll beat any army i've ever seen  killing our men wasn't war for them it was sport  her dragon burned a thousand wagons  qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you  they couldn't stop it  and she has three of them  this isn't a war we can win   he didn't   i'm not talking about father  tyrion didn't kill joffrey  he had nothing to do with it   it was olenna  she confessed before she died   after   if you were olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to joffrey or tommen  which one would margerey been better able to control  which one would have made olenna the true ruler of the seven kingdoms  she was telling the truth   she's dead like her son her grandchildren her whole house  and if we don't find a way out of this war we'll follow them   we don't have time for this  we should be preparing the city for a siege  the dothraki are coming   i seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well   why down here   today might be the day i kill you by accident   don't talk about our father   i once told bronn that if i ever saw you again i'd cut you in half   what do you want   you want cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself   why was qyburn here   i met with tyrion   daenerys wants to meet   to discuss an armistice   because an army of dead men is marching on the seven kingdoms  tyrion claims he'll have proof   tyrion   you let it happen  why   who will you say is the father   people won't like that   the lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep,5,7,343
16,jon,  that wasn't the word i was thinking of but yes they are  gorgeous beasts   you weren't gone long   and   no i'm not   thousands   ser davos gets carried away   i served with your father  he was a great man   i thought arya was dead  i thought bran was dead   bran saw the night king and his army marching towards eastwatch  if they make it past the wall --   i need to go home   we'll fight with the men we have  unless you'll join us   i don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation   the first white i ever saw was brought into castle black from beyond the wall   the free folk will help us  they know the real north better than anyone   they won't have to   i'm the only one here whose fought them  i'm the only one here who knows them   with respect your grace i don't need your permission  i am a king  and i came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive  i put my trust in you a stranger because i knew it was the best chance for my people for all our people  now i'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance   you survived king's landing   your grace this is --   i saw your father once at winterfell   you're a lot leaner   i grew up on stories about them   do you know how to use one   well that's a problem   we could use the help   if i don't return at least you won't have to deal with the king in the north anymore   i wish you good fortune in the wars to come your grace   heave   two   both   not enough   you're the hound  i saw you once at winterfell   he's right  we're all on the same side   we're all breathing,5,7,310
17,jorah,  your grace   i wouldn't be here if i hadn't  i return to your service my queen if you'll have me   with the queen's permission i'll go north and take one   you asked me to find a cure so i could serve you  allow me to serve you   it was supposed to last us the rest of our lives   your grace i --   we were hoping some of your men could help   thoros   i hardly recognized you   he was my father   you returned the favor as i recall   don't you want to know what we're doing,5,7,95
18,little finger,  are you sure this is the only copy at winterfell   lady stark thanks you for your service,5,7,17
19,marwyn,  i remember wolkan   a bit timid but a sharp mind   it is a bit much  still we ought to --   do you know him   and   i sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming   it could be done  and this news could be authentic  it's possible  it's also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest   we will write to maester wolkan at winterfell for clarification  i promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another   that will be all tarley   i'm afraid so   i don't have the heart to tell him yet  he's a good lad   right  the ravenry was falling apart last time i checked,5,7,134
20,qyburn,  my lord   ser jaime,5,7,4
21,randyll,  i already have a queen   there are no easy choices in war  say what you will about your sister she was born in westeros has lived here all her life  you on the other hand you murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader  one with no ties to this land an army of savages at her back   you cannot send me to the wall  you are not my queen   step back and shut your mouth   a stupid boy,5,7,82
22,robett,  the king in the north should stay in the north  we did not choose you to rule us my lady but perhaps we should have,5,7,25
23,sam,  no,5,7,1
24,samwell,  brandon stark --   i let him through the wall years ago  i saw him go beyond the wall   somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could  not the night's watch not the wildlings no one  perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say   everyone in westeros trusts and respects you  if you tell people the threat is real they'll believe it  if you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall they'll do it  and if you tell every maester in the citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night they may find something that lets us defeat the army of the dead for good   archmaester please  it's real  i've seen it   archmaester --   none anymore   it's when a man sets asside his lawful wife   these maesters they set me to the task of preserving that man's window counting and anullments and bowel movements for all eternity while the secret to defeating the night king's probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere completely ignored  but that's all right isn't it  we could all become slavering murderous imbecils enthralled to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full records of high septon meynard's 15782 shits   i'm tired of reading about the achievements of better men,5,7,228
25,sandor,  for fuck's sake will you shut your hole  are we coming with you or not,5,7,15
26,sansa,  you're very kind my lords but jon is our king  he is doing what he thinks is best   i warned jon this would happen  he can't leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like ghost   well he's not making it easy  the northern lords are proud   and   don't do that   say what you mean   are you angry with me   i listened to their complaints which is my responsibility as lady of winterfell   glover has 500 men  royce has 2000  offend them and jon loses his army   winterfell didn't just fall into our hands  we took it back and the mormonts and the hornwoods and the wildlings and the vale all of us working together  now i'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying but that's not the way you get people to work together   how can you even think such a horrible thing   i have work to do,5,7,154
27,thoros,  ser jorah mormont --   they won't give me anything to drink down here  i haven't been feeling like myself   is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die,5,7,31
28,tormund,  isn't it your job to talk him out of stupid fucking ideas like this   how many queens are there now   and you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother   how many men did you bring   the big woman   you are   you really want to go out there again   you're not the only ones   my scouts found them a mile south of the wall  said they were on their way here   they want to go beyond the wall too   you're a fucking mormont  like the last lord commander   he hunted us like animals,5,7,100
29,tyrion,  my sister she wasn't your queen until recently though was she until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed house tyrell for all time  so it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible   perhaps he could take the black your grace  whatever else he is he is a true soldier  he would be invaluable at the wall   you are the future of your house  this war has already wiped one great house from the world  don't let it happen again  bend the knee   your grace nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell   your grace if you begin beheading entire families --   your grace --   all rulers demand that people bend the knee  it's why they're rulers  she gave tarley a choice  a man who had taken up arms against her  what else could she do   i am her hand not her head  i can't make her decisions for her   daenerys is not her father   who is that for   did you read it   what's it say   perhaps not  cersei thinks the army of the dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children  what if we prove her wrong   so bring the dead to her   we don't have to bring the whole army  only one soldier   bring one of these things down to king's landing and show her the truth   the only person she listens to is jaime  he may listen to me   last time i was here i killed my father with a crossbow   you're not staying here   what if someone takes the boat   i needed to see you and i knew you'd never agree to meet   you made me look like a complete fool  i thought i'd surprise you by hitting casterly rock but you were three steps ahead of me  you abandoned the family home  completely unsentimental  father would have been proud   listen to me --   it would take you awhile with a sparring sword   he was going to execute me  he knew i was innocent  he didn't hate me because of anything i did he hated me because of what i am  the little monster sent to punish him  do you think i wanted to be born this way  did he think i chose --   daenerys will win this war  you're a military man  you must know there is no way around it  daenerys is not her father  she's even willing to suspend hostilities if cersei agrees to certain terms   fish hook  some men you just can't teach   he'll do   you may not believe it but i've missed you mormont  nobody glowers quite like you  not even grey worm   this is the coin the slaver gave me when i suggested he free us and pay us  remember   take it with you  you'll bring it back  our queen needs you,5,7,475
30,varys,"  not burn him alive alongside his son   that's what i used to tell myself about her father  i found the traitors but i wasn't the one burning them alive  i was only a purveyor of information   it's what i told myself when i watched them beg for mercy ""i'm not the one doing it""  as the pitch of their screams rose higher ""i'm not the one doing it""  when their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the thone room ""i'm not the one doing it""   and she never will be with the right counsel  you need to find a way to make her listen   jon snow   it's a sealed scroll for the king in the north   nothing good   the wall has kept them out for thousands of years  presumably --   anything you bring back will be useless unless cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital   fair point  how do you propose to find one",5,7,173
31,wolkan,  i found it my lord   it took some searching  maester llewyn's archives are thorough   yes my lord,5,7,17

0,arya,"  father used to watch us from up here  he wouldn't say much  you probably don't remember  you were inside knitting all the time   one time the boys were shooting arrows with ser rodrick  i came out here after and bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground  ser rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw  there was one arrow in the target  there was no one around just like now  no one to stop me  so i started shooting  and every shot i had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again  i wasn't very good  finally i hit the bullseye  it could have been the 20th shot or the 50th  i don't remember  but i hit the bullseye and i heard this   i looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me  i knew what i was doing was against the rules  but he was smiling so i knew it wasn't wrong  the rules were wrong  i was doing what i was meant to be doing and he knew it  now he's dead  killed by the lannisters with your help   that's your pretty handwriting  septa mordane used to crack my knuckles because i couldn't write as well as you  ""robb i write to you today with heavy heart  our good king robert is dead  killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt --   ""father has been charged with treason  he conspired with robert's brothers against my beloved joffrey and tried to steal his throne  the lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort  i beg you come to king's landing swear fealty to king joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of lannister and stark  your faithful sister sansa""   did they  with a knife at your throat  did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop   so was i  i would have let them kill me before i betrayed my family   and you were stupid enough to believe them  i remember you standing on that platform with joffrey and cersei when they dragged father too the block  i remember the pretty dress you were wearing  i remember the fancy way you did your hair   i was there standing in the crowd near baelor's statue   i wanted to   i didn't betray him  i didn't betray robb  i didn't betray our entire family for my beloved joffrey   i was training   oh i don't know about that  i can imagine quite a lot   i guess we'll never know   i don't know yet   you're scared aren't you  what are you scared of  you didn't commit any crimes  no one's going to hang you   are you scared i'll show it to jon and he'll be angry  no  that's not jon  he'll understand  you were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked lannisters   the northern lords will read it  they wouldn't think much of lady sansa if they knew how she did cersei's bidding  what would little lyanna mormont say  she's younger than you were when you wrote this  are you going to say ""but i was just a child""   sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things  i'll go with anger",6,7,546
1,beric,  we're fighting a great war  wars cost money   you don't much look like him   your father  i suppose you favor your mother   of course i did  when he was hand he sent me off hunting for the mountain  your wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back  thoros has brought me back six times  we both serve the same lord   the north didn't raise you from the dead   he wants you alive   i don't know   i think about that all the time  i don't think it's our purpose to understand except one thing  we're soldiers  we have to know what we're fighting for  i'm not fighting so some man or woman i barely know can sit on a throne made of swords   life  death is the enemy  the first enemy and the last   the enemy always wins  and we still need to fight him  that's all i know  you and i wont find much joy while we're here  but we can keep others alive  we can defend those who can't defend themselves   maybe we don't need to understand any more than that  maybe that's enough,6,7,187
2,daenerys,  do you know what i like about you   you're not a hero   i don't want you to be a hero  heroes do stupid things and they die  drogo jorah dario even this jon snow they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist bravest thing   jon snow's not in love with me,6,7,56

5,jorah,  he was a good man  he deserved a better son  were you with him at the end   i can't think of a worse way for him to go  the night's watch was his life  he would have died to protect every one of those men and they butchered him   your father wanted to execute me   he was in the right of course  it didn't make me hate him any less   me too   he gave it to you   i brought shame to my house  i broke my father's heart   i forfeited the right to claim this sword  it's yours  may it serve you well and your children after you,6,7,108
6,sandor,  sounds all right so far   was she naked too   it could have been worse   but they didn't did they  so what you whinging about   your lips are moving and you're complaining about something  that's whinging   this one's been killed six times  you don't hear him bitching about it   fuck off   i don't give two shits about wildlings   gingers i hate   don't point your fucking finger at me   i didn't trip  i was pushed   will you fuck off   do you want to suck my dick  is that it   cock   i bet you do   brienne of tarth   you're with brienne of fucking tarth   how does she look at you  like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver   we've met   how did a mad fucker like you live this long   that's what i saw in the fire   a mountain like an arrowhead   we're getting close,6,7,145
7,sansa,  i remember   what   you don't have to read it  i remember   they forced me to do it   you don't know what it was like  i was a child   they told me it was the only way to save father   you were there   and what did you do  did you come running to the rescue  did you fight off the lannisters and save father   but you didn't  just like me   you should be on your knees thanking me  we're standing in winterfell again because of me  you didn't win it back  jon didn't win it back  he lost the battle of the bastards  the knight's of the vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where traveling the world   training  well while you were training i suffered things you can never imagine   you never would have survived what i survived   what are you doing to do with that letter   who did you show it to  where did you find it   arya --   do you know how happy cersei would be if she saw us fighting  this is exactly what she wants  this is what she's always wanted to tear us apart --   you're angry  sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things,6,7,206
8,thoros,  are you still mad at us boy   priestess  i'll admit it is a subtle distinction   she needed your blood   good lad   are you sure,6,7,24
9,tormund,  beautiful eh  i can breath again  down south the air smells like pig shit   i've been to winterfell   you have to keep moving  that's the secret  walking is good fighting is better fucking is best   we have to make due with what we've got   this one is maybe not so smart   good  that's more important than being smart   smart people don't come up here looking for the dead  so you met this dragon queen huh  and   you spent too much time with the free folk and now you don't like kneeling  mance rayder was a great man a proud man  the king beyond the wall never bent the knee  how many of his people died for his pride   you’re the one they call the dog   they told me you were mean  were you born mean or you just hate wildlings   gingers are beautiful  we are kissed by fire  just like you   did you trip into the fire when you were a baby   ever since you've been mean   i don't think you're truly mean  you have sad eyes   dick   ah  dick  i like it   nope  it's pussy for me  i have a beauty waiting for me back at winterfell  if i ever get back there  yellow hair  blue eyes  tallest woman you've ever seen  almost as tall as you   you know her   well not with her yet but i see the way she looks at me   you do know her   i want to make babies with her  think of the great big monsters  they'd conquer the world   i'm good at killing people,6,7,261
10,tyrion,  i honestly don't   oh  i've been heroic on occasion   i once charged through the mud gate of king's landing   it's interesting these heroes you name  drogo jorah dario even this jon snow they all fell in love with you   oh my mistake  i suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance,6,7,57
0,arya," are you sure you want to do this  and what does honor demand  all right then get on with it  my sister asked you a question  you told our mother  are you all right  you did the right thing  i'm just the executioner you passed the sentence you're the lady  i was never going to be as good a lady as you so i had to be something else i never could have survived what you survived  i believe that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me  ""in winter we must protect ourselves look after one another""  i miss him",7,7,101
1,beric, it's a long way down,7,7,5
2,bran," you held a knife to his throat  you said ""i did warn you not the trust me""  come in  samwell tarly  i remember everything  you helped us get beyond the wall you're a good man  i became the three-eyed raven  i can see things that happened in the past i can see things happening now all over the world why did you come to winterfell  he's on his way back to winterfell with daenerys targaryen you you saw this  in a vision  he needs to know the truth  about himself no one knows no one but me jon isn't really my father's son he's the son of rhaegar targaryen and my aunt  dornish bastards are named sand  are you certain  robert's rebellion was built on a lie rhaegar didn't kidnap my aunt  he loved her and she loved him  he's never been a bastard",7,7,144
3,bran's voice, he needs to know we need to tell him,7,7,9
4,brienne, i thought you were dead  i was only trying to protect her  she's alive arya  winterfell  the only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way  ser jaime  we both saw what just happened we both saw that thing  oh fuck loyalty  this goes beyond houses and honor and oaths talk to the queen,7,7,58
5,bronn," oil  how many barrels  get 500 more  i still enjoy it when they call me ""my lord""  if we live that long men without cocks you wouldn't find me fighting in an army if i had no cock what's left to fight for  i spent my life around soldiers what do you think they spend that gold on  not without a cock you don't  yet your brother--  i think we're about to be the downtrodden  welcome my lords your friends arrived before you did  i've been sent to escort you all to the meeting  come on you can suck his magic cock later  i'm sure your new queen--  don't you worry about me i'm doing all right looking after myself  i put yourself at risk important difference it's your head queen cersei's offered a bag of gold for it's not mine now thanks to me she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door she can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes all thanks to ser bronn of the fucking blackwater if that's not looking after myself i don't know what is  yeah you too  come on pod let's you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk eh",7,7,216
6,cersei, why isn't she with them  and the rest of them  including our brother   if anything goes wrong kill the silver-haired bitch first then our brother then the bastard who calls himself king  where is she  didn't travel with you  we've been here for some time  sit down or leave  so instead we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days  then why are we here  i imagine for most of them it would be an improvement  i don't think it's serious at all i think it's another bad joke if my brother jaime has informed me correctly you're asking me for a truce  that's all pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt or while you solidify and expand your position hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men  the word of a would-be usurper  what are you talking about  he's right to be afraid and a coward to run if those things come for us there will be no kingdoms to rule everything we suffered will have been for nothing everything we lost will have been for nothing the crown accepts your truce until the dead are defeated they are the true enemy  in return the king   i would never ask it of you you would never agree to it and if you did i would trust you even less than i do now i ask it only of ned stark's son i know ned stark's son  then there is nothing left to discuss the dead will come north first enjoy dealing with them we will deal with whatever is left of you  i shouldn't be surprised i suppose she's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place  so you bring her here with her pet northerner  whom you've convinced to bow down before her  and now you've got them both working towards the same goal the goal you've worked towards your entire life  the destruction of this family  you killed our father  oh poor little man your papa was mean to you do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow you left us open you laid us bare for the vultures and the vultures came and tore us apart you may not have killed joffrey but you killed myrcella you killed tommen no one would've touched them if father--  i will not hear it not from you  i will not hear it  i will not  it doesn't matter your love doesn't matter your feelings don't matter i don't care why you did what you did i only care what it cost us it cost us our future  not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction  what did you hope for  to make jon snow submit to your queen  but eventually you want everyone to bend the knee to her  why  you said she'd destroy king's landing  that's the difference between you i don't care about checking my worst impulses i don't care about making the world a better place hang the world  that thing you dragged here i know what it is i know what it means and when it came at me i didn't think about the world not at all as soon as it opened its mouth the world disappeared for me right down its black throat all i could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most away from my family maybe euron greyjoy had the right idea get on a boat take those who matter  my armies will not stand down i will not pull them back to the capital i will march them north to fight alongside you in the great war the darkness is coming for us all we'll face it together and when the great war is over perhaps you'll remember i chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you i expect not call our banners all of them  ser jaime  my lords i need a moment with my brother  what are you doing  expedition north i always knew you were the stupidest lannister the starks and targaryens have united against us and you want to fight alongside them are you a traitor or an idiot  i'll say whatever i need to say to ensure the survival of our house you expect me to trust the man who murdered our father  i saw it burn if dragons can't stop them if dothraki and unsullied and northmen can't stop them how will our armies make a difference  and i intend to stay amongst the living let the stark boy and his new queen--  our child will rule westeros  the monsters are real the white walkers the dragons the dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young they're all real so be it let the monsters kill each other and while they battle in the north we take back the lands that belong to us  and then we rule  the targaryens and the starks already want to kill us all most of them will die in the north  how many dragons did you see at the pit  what happened to the third  she came here with her dragons and her dothraki and her unsullied she came here to show us all her power no something happenedthe dragons are vulnerable  no we have something better we have the iron bank you should've listened more when father--  do you really think euron greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the iron islands do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen  and you conspired with tyrion the man who murdered our father without telling me your queen  you met with him in secret without my consent you planned to promote my enemies' interests that is the definition of conspiracy  and that will be treason  disobeying your queen  i told you no one walks away from me   there's one more yet to come,7,7,1024
7,daenerys, my apologies  yes that's all  your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with you have my word  i didn't believe it until i saw them i saw them all  a hundred thousand at least  just the king  i'm grateful for your loyalty but my dragon died so that we could be here if it's all for nothing then he died for nothing  i didn't come all this way to have my hand    i know i respect what you did wish you hadn't done it but i respect it  this place was the beginning of the end for my family  a dragon is not a slave they were terrifying extraordinary they filled people with wonder and awe and we locked them in here they wasted away they grew small and we grew small as well we weren't extraordinary without them we were just like everyone else  i can't have children  the witch who murdered my husband  you were right from the beginning if i had trusted you everything would be different  i can't forget what i saw north of the wall and i can't pretend that cersei won't take back half the country the moment i march north    and the unsullied we can sail with them to white harbor meet the dothraki here on the kingsroad then ride together to winterfell  i've not come to conquer the north i'm coming to save the north we sail together,7,7,240
8,davos, maybe it still is  i wish you hadn't done that  any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs,7,7,22
9,euron, theon i have your sister  then why are you talking you're the smallest concern here  we don't even let your kind live in the iron islands you know we kill you at birth an act of mercy for the parents  why  can they swim  good i'm taking the iron fleet back to the iron islands  i've been around the world i've seen everything things you couldn't imagine and this this is the only thing i've ever seen that terrifies me  i'm going back to my island you should go back to yours when winter's over we'll be the only ones left alive,7,7,102
10,harrag, load up load up lads go on tide's coming in  your sister--   she's dead even if euron hasn't cut her throat yet she's dead  she's your sister  so why in fuck's name should we listen to you they say the dead can't swim we're going to sail east find a nice quiet island kill all the men and take their wives for ourselves  who says we are  run away little theon it's what you do best  stay down or i'll kill you   i said stay down or i'll kill you,7,7,90
11,jaime, the thrill will fade  gold  family  maybe it really is all cocks in the end  yes he's always been a champion of the downtrodden  perhaps you ought to sit down  how many  it's been good to see you i imagine the next time will be across a battlefield  yes and i'm not looking forward to seeing more of them but i'm loyal to the queen and you're loyal to sansa and her dolt brother  fuck loyalty  and tell her what  at her until she kicked me out she thinks i was an idiot to trust you a lot of people seem to think that actually  i suppose we should say goodbye one idiot to another  our men in king's landing will march north in three days' time  we don't have a fortnight if the north falls we fall three days the remaining forces in the westerlands will take the river road east we'll meet at lord harroway's town and march together to winterfell  your grace  preparing the expedition north  you pledged our forces to fight our common enemy  you saw it with your own eyes you saw a dead man trying to kill us  this isn't about noble houses this is about the living and the dead  i made a promise  our child will never be born if the dead come south  and then what  when the fighting in the north is over someone wins you understand that don't you if the dead win they march south and kill us all if the living win and we've betrayed them they march south and kill us all  i faced them in the field we can't beat them we can't beat their dragons  two  for all we know it's guarding her fleet  we can't beat the dothraki we don't have the numbers we don't have the support of the other houses  the golden company is not here they're in essos how is a mercenary company in essos going to help us  you plotted with euron greyjoy without telling me the commander  i didn't conspire with him  i pledged to ride north i intend to honor that pledge  treason  doesn't matter what i'd call it  are you going to order him to kill me i'm the only one you have left our children are gone our father  give the order then  i  don't believe you,7,7,392
12,john royce, i think not,7,7,3
13,jon,  how many people live here  that's more people than the entire north crammed into that why would anyone want to live that way  this isn't about living in harmony it's just about living the same thing is coming for all of us a general you can't negotiate with an army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield lord tyrion tells me a million people live in this city they're about to become a million more soldiers in the army of the dead  this is serious i wouldn't be here if it weren't   we can destroy them by burning them  and we can destroy them with dragonglass if we don't win this fight then that is the fate of every person in the world  there is only one war that matters the great war and it is here  no    i am true to my word or i try to be that is why i cannot give you what you ask i cannot serve two queens and i have already pledged myself to queen daenerys of house targaryen  i know  i'm not going to swear an oath i can't uphold talk about my father  i did this i should go  no one is less happy about this than i am  you're not like everyone else and your family hasn't seen its end you're still here  who told you that  has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information  so what now  it appears tyrion's assessment was correct we're fucked  if we have the dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad they'll arrive at winterfell within the fortnight  it's your decision your grace but if we're going to be allies in this war it's important for the northerners to see us as allies if we sail to white harbor together i think it sends a better message  all right  we went down there to make peace and it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together  it's not it may seem that way from the outside but i promise you it's not true i've done plenty of things that i regret  no not compared to you  our father was more of a father  and you betrayed him betrayed his memory   but you never lost him he's a part of you just like he's a part of me  it's not my place to forgive you for all of it but what i can forgive i do you don't need to choose you're a greyjoy and you're a stark  so why are you still talking to me,7,7,437
14,jorah, dragons don't understand the difference between what is theirs and what isn't land livestock children letting them roam free around a city was a problem  perhaps you should fly to winterfell your grace you have many enemies in the north thousands fell fighting your fatherall it takes is one angry man with a crossbow he'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero the man who killed the conqueror,7,7,79
15,little finger, it's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms perhaps jon tried to send word earlier  i can't believe he'd surrender the northern crown without consulting you  i've heard gossip that the dragon queen is quite beautiful  jon is young and unmarried daenerys is young and unmarried  an alliance makes sense together they'd be difficult to defeat he was named king  you are family too would arya really murder her own sister  only by reputation they worship the god of death i believe i never trust godly men  she's your sister  why did she come to winterfell  why did she unearth the letter cersei made you write  and after she murders you what does she become  lady sansa forgive me i'm a bit confused  i did it to protect you  whatever your aunt  i know of no such letter  i deny it none of you were there to see what happened none of you knows the truth  lady sansa i have known you since you were a girl i've protected you  if we could speak alone i can explain everything  sansa please  give me a chance to defend myself i deserve that  i am lord protector of the vale and i command you to escort me safely back to the eyrie  sansa i beg you i loved your mother since the time i was a boy  i loved you more than anyone  sansa  i--,7,7,235
16,lyanna, father smith warrior mother maiden crone stranger i am his and he is mine from this day until the end of my days  his name is aegon,7,7,27
17,man, archers stand tall  he needs to shut his mouth  hey  it'll take us a fortnight just to gather supplies for the train  i can see movement watch on the tree line,7,7,31

23,qyburn, i'm afraid i don't know your grace no one has seen her  they're on their way to the dragon pit now  yes your grace,7,7,24
24,rhaegar,  father smith warrior mother maiden crone stranger i am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days,7,7,23
25,sam, i wasn't sure if you'd remember me  oh well thank you but um i'm not sure that i am what happened to you beyond the wall  oh i don't know what that means  um jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead i know he is but he can't do it alone so i've come here to help him  oh  the truth about what  it's not  at the citadel i transcribed a high septon's diary he annulled rhaegar's marriage to elia he wed rhaegar and lyanna in a secret ceremony   it's what the high septon wrote in his private diary i don't know why he'd lie is this something you can see,7,7,114
26,sandor, fuck off  not yet you came pretty close  you and me both  where  who's protecting her if you're here  it won't be me  anyone touches it i'll kill you first  i left this shit city because i didn't want to die in it am i going to die in this shit city  and this is all your idea seems every bad idea has some lannister cunt behind it  remember me yeah you do you're even fucking uglier than i am now what did they do to you doesn't matter that's not how it ends for you brother,7,7,97
27,sansa, no this is the way he is the way he's always been he never asked for my opinion why would he start now  this is his writing his signature he pledged to fight for daenerys targaryen he's bent the knee  what does that have to do with anything  you think he wants to marry her  even if i wanted to arya would never go along she always loved jon far more than she ever loved me and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family  do you know what she is now do you know what the faceless men are  they're killers and arya was one of them what do you think she's after  she could want me dead because she thinks i wronged my family  to kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family  to provide proof of my betrayals to provide justification after she murders me  lady  have my sister  it's not what i want it's what honor demands  that i defend my family from those who would harm us that i defend the north from those who would betray us  you stand accused of murder you stand accused of treason how do you answer these charges lord baelish  which charges confuse you let's start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt lysa arryn you pushed her through the moon door and watched her fall do you deny it  you did it to take power in the vale earlier you conspired to murder jon  you had aunt lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the lannisters who murdered jon  you conspired with cersei lannister and joffrey baratheon to betray our father  protected me by selling me to the boltons  sometimes when i'm trying to understand a person's motives i play a little game i assume the worst what's the worst reason you have for turning me against my sisterthat's what you do isn't it that's what you've always done turn family against family turn sister against sister that's what you did to our mother  i'm a slow learner it's true but i learn    and yet you betrayed her  and yet you betrayed me  when you brought me back to winterfell you told me there's no justice in the world not unless we make it thank you for all your many lessons lord baelish i will never forget them  it's just strange in his own horrible way i believe he loved me  you did it  does that bother you  you would have you're the strongest person i know  well don't get used to it you're still very strange and annoying  father  me too,7,7,440
28,soldier, pitch my lord  500 my lord   yes my lord  what's in there,7,7,12
29,theon, jon  can i speak with you  what you did in king's landing what you said you could've lied to cersei about bending the knee to daenerys you risked everything to tell an enemy the truth  you've always known what was right even when we were all young and stupid you always knew every step you take it's always the right step  not compared to me you haven't  i always wanted to do the right thing be the right kind of person but i never knew what that meant it always seemed like there's like there was an impossible choice i had to make stark or greyjoy  he was  i did  but the things i've done  when i was ramsay's prisoner yara tried to save me she's the only one who tried to save me  she needs me now  all of us chose to follow yara we left the iron islands for yara she would never leave one of us behind we're not leaving her behind   she's not dead  she's our queen  i did i ran from my uncle   we're done with all that  yara did she made a pledge we're going to find her and we're going to set her free  not for me for yara,7,7,206
30,tormund, yeah the crows keep telling me i'll get used to it  come on  run run,7,7,15
31,tyrion, a million give or take  there's more work in the city and the brothels are far superior  i imagine it was a sad joke at the end an entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs but in the beginning when it was home to balerion the dread it must have been the most dangerous place in the world  a pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation  supporting the enemy no less  cersei will anyway    here we are the heroes of blackwater bay strange place for a reunion  i don't think i'm anyone's lord anymore podrick save the titles for ser bronn of the blackwater  you've been thinking about our new queen  are you helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself was it you put yourself at risk  it's good to see you again  you might  and some clegane cunt to help them see it through  she'll be here soon  no  we are all facing a unique  i think we ought to begin with larger concerns  do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes his wasn't even good he explained it at the end never explain it always ruins it  we are a group of people who do not like one another as this recent demonstration has shown we have suffered at each other's hands we have lost people we love at each other's hands if all we wanted was more of the same there would be no need for this gathering we are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face  we all know that will never happen  there is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years we have something to show you  i'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen  that is indeed a problem the more immediate problem is that we're fucked  only one everyone stays here and i go and talk to my sister  i don't want cersei to murder me either i could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble   she'll definitely murder you i go see my sister  you spoke with her  i'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice that i know of who's an idiot  a foreign whore you can't abduct beat or intimidate that must be difficult for you   i didn't know about that   cersei i didn't know  i am the one preventing that from happening daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate she didn't want to bring you words she wanted to bring you fire and blood until i advised her otherwise i don't want to destroy our family i never have  after he sentenced me to death for a crime i didn't commit yes i killed him hate me for it if you want i hate myself for it in spite of what he was in spite of what he did to me   i have never been more sorry about anything    all right you love your family and i have destroyed it i will always be a threat so put an end to me  if it weren't for me you'd have a motherif it weren't for me you'd have a father  i am more sorry about the children than you could ever know   i don't care i loved them you know i did you know it in your heart if there's anything left of it  if there's no future then why are we here why did you allow me to come  yes no not what you hoped for but you must have hoped for something  mm not like this  yes  because i think she will make the world a better place  she knows herself she chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them  you're pregnant,7,7,641
32,varys, and that would be double what now exactly,7,7,8
0,tyrion,you should consider yourself lucky at least your balls won't freeze off,1,8,12
1,varys,you take great offense at dwarf jokes but love telling eunuch jokes why is that,1,8,15
2,tyrion,because i have balls and you don't,1,8,7

15,umber,we need more horses and wagons if it please my lady,1,8,11
16,umber,and my lord,1,8,3
17,umber,and my queen sorry,1,8,4
18,sansa,you'll have as many as we can spare hurry back to last hearth and bring your people here,1,8,18
19,jon,we need to send ravens to the night's watch as well there's no sense in manning the castles anymore we make our stand here,1,8,24
20,wolkan,at once your grace,1,8,4
21,lyanna,your grace,1,8,2
22,lyanna,but you're not are you you left winterfell a king and came back a- i'm not sure what you are now,1,8,21
23,lyanna,a lord nothing at all,1,8,5
24,jon,it's not important,1,8,3
25,lyanna,not important we named you king in the north,1,8,9
26,man,king of the north,1,8,4
27,jon,you did my lady it was the honor of my life i'll always be grateful for your faith but when i left winterfell i told you we need allies or we will die i have brought those allies home to fight alongside us i had a choice keep my crown or protect the north i chose the north,1,8,58
28,tyrion,if anyone survives the war to come we'll have jon snow to thank he risked his life to show us the threat is real thanks to his courage we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen we have brought two full-grown dragons and soon the lannister army will ride north to join our cause,1,8,59
29,tyrion,i know i know our people haven't been friends in the past but we must fight together now or die,1,8,20
30,sansa,may i ask how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen while i ensured our stores would last through winter i didn't account for dothraki unsullied and two full-grown dragons what do dragons eat anyway,1,8,41
31,daenerys,whatever they want,1,8,3
32,gendry,hey careful lads we need every last bit of it,1,8,10
33,man,sorry 'bout that,1,8,3
34,gendry,are these the last of the wagons,1,8,7
35,man,aye,1,8,1
36,gendry,all right let's get it all to the forges,1,8,9
37,tyrion,my lord my lady,1,8,4
38,royce,my lady,1,8,2
39,tyrion,the lady of winterfell has a nice ring to it,1,8,10
40,sansa,so does hand of the queen depending on the queen i suppose,1,8,12
41,tyrion,last time we spoke was at joffrey's wedding miserable affair,1,8,10
42,sansa,it had its moments,1,8,4
43,sansa,apologies for leaving like that,1,8,5
44,tyrion,yes it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder,1,8,17
45,sansa,we both survived,1,8,3
46,tyrion,many underestimated you most of them are dead now,1,8,9
47,tyrion,i'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the lannister army's marching north you have every right to be fearful of my sister no one fears her more than i do but i promise you'll be safe-,1,8,36
48,sansa,cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you,1,8,12
49,tyrion,she did,1,8,2
50,sansa,and you believed her,1,8,4
51,tyrion,she has something to live for now i believe she wants to survive,1,8,13
52,sansa,i used to think you were the cleverest man alive,1,8,10
53,arya,you used to be taller,1,8,5
54,jon,how did you sneak up on me,1,8,7
55,arya,how did you survive a knife through the heart,1,8,9
56,jon,i didn't,1,8,2
57,jon,you still have it,1,8,4
58,arya,needle,1,8,1
59,jon,have you ever used it,1,8,5
60,arya,once or twice,1,8,3
61,arya,valyrian steel,1,8,2
62,jon,jealous,1,8,1
63,arya,too heavy for me,1,8,4
64,jon,where were you before i couldo ve used your help with sansa,1,8,12
65,arya,she doesn't like your queen does she,1,8,7
66,jon,sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone,1,8,6
67,arya,she's the smartest person i've ever met,1,8,7
68,jon,now you're defending her,1,8,4
69,jon,you,1,8,1
70,arya,i'm defending our family so is she,1,8,7
71,jon,yeah i'm her family too,1,8,5
72,arya,don't forget that,1,8,3
73,qyburn,your grace i'm afraid i bring terrible news the dead have broken through the wall,1,8,15
74,cersei,good,1,8,1
75,yara,why don't you just get it over with and kill me,1,8,11
76,euron,but we're family the last greyjoys left in the world the last ones with balls anyway,1,8,16
77,euron,if i kill you who can i talk to hmm,1,8,10
78,euron,i've got a crew full of mutes it gets lonely at sea,1,8,12
79,yara,are we in king's landing,1,8,5
80,euron,mm,1,8,1
81,yara,you picked the losing side,1,8,5
82,euron,then i'll sail the iron fleet somewhere else,1,8,8
83,euron,but first i'm gonna fuck the queen,1,8,7
84,cersei,twenty-thousand men is it,1,8,4
85,harry,yes your grace a few died in transit,1,8,8
86,euron,they cheated at dice or maybe i cheated someone cheated they weren't good fighters you won't miss them,1,8,18
87,cersei,horses,1,8,1
88,harry,two thousand,1,8,2
89,cersei,and elephants,1,8,2
90,harry,uh no elephants your grace,1,8,5
91,cersei,that's disappointing i was told the golden company had elephants,1,8,10
92,harry,they are excellent beasts your grace but not well-suited to long sea voyages,1,8,13
93,cersei,in any event you are most welcome here in king's landing captain strickland,1,8,13
94,harry,we look forward to fighting on your behalf your grace,1,8,10
95,euron,am i most welcome here,1,8,5
96,cersei,you are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest,1,8,12
97,euron,good as a true friend and an honored guest,1,8,9
98,euron,i was hoping we could talk in private,1,8,8
99,cersei,after the war that was our agreement,1,8,7
100,euron,wars sometimes last years,1,8,4
101,cersei,you want a whore buy one you want a queen earn her,1,8,12
102,euron,how,1,8,1
103,euron,i've given her justice an army and the iron fleet yet she gives me no sign of affection my heart is nearly broken,1,8,23
104,cersei,you're insolent i've executed men for less,1,8,7
105,euron,they were lesser men,1,8,4
106,dirah,i hear the dragon burnt up a thousand lannister men,1,8,10
107,crayah,burnt up some of my favorite boys,1,8,7
108,dirah,archie was it,1,8,3
109,crayah,and william,1,8,2
110,dirah,tall handsome william,1,8,3
111,crayah,yeah tall handsome william,1,8,4
112,dirah,they said what's left of him could fit in a wine glass,1,8,12
113,bronn,i am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon,1,8,12
114,crayah,did you,1,8,2
115,bronn,nearly killed it,1,8,3
116,marei,that's brave,1,8,2
117,crayah,that boy eddie,1,8,3
118,dirah,the ginger,1,8,2
119,crayah,that's him came back with his face burnt right off he's got no eyelids now,1,8,15
120,dirah,how does he sleep with no eyelids,1,8,7
121,bronn,all right can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now,1,8,11
122,qyburn,ser bronn of the blackwater,1,8,5
123,bronn,you're kidding me,1,8,3
124,qyburn,apologies for the interruption but the queen did urge me to hurry,1,8,12
125,bronn,sorry ladies another time perhaps,1,8,5
126,crayah,you ever get lonely,1,8,4
127,qyburn,poor girl the pox will take her within the year,1,8,10
128,bronn,which girl,1,8,2
129,qyburn,the queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them her grace wants to rectify their mistake,1,8,17
130,bronn,she once gave me a castle and a wife then rectified me right out of them,1,8,16
131,qyburn,that was ser jaime's doing not hers when queen cersei wants something she pays in advance and in gold several chests of it in fact waiting for you in a wagon just outside,1,8,33
132,bronn,so she wants to murder someone but she can't send her soldiers if it's the dragon queen she's after-,1,8,19
133,qyburn,she has other plans for the targaryen girl,1,8,8
134,bronn,yeah well good luck with that,1,8,6
135,qyburn,our queen's brothers are unlikely to survive their northern adventures but in the event that they do-,1,8,17
136,qyburn,she has a keen sense of poetic justice,1,8,8
137,bronn,that fucking family,1,8,3
138,qyburn,when the citadel expelled me i thought i would die poor and alone but in exchange for my service queen cersei made me her hand what would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers,1,8,39
139,cersei,i wanted those elephants,1,8,4
140,euron,so how do i compare to the fat king,1,8,9
141,cersei,you're insulting my late husband,1,8,5
142,euron,are you offended,1,8,3
143,cersei,robert had a different whore every night but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body,1,8,18
144,euron,and the kingslayer,1,8,3
145,cersei,you enjoy risking your neck don't you,1,8,7
146,euron,life is boring,1,8,3
147,cersei,you're not boring i'll give you that,1,8,7
148,euron,do i please the queen,1,8,5
149,cersei,you might be the most arrogant man i've ever met i like that,1,8,13
150,cersei,but now i want to be alone,1,8,7
151,euron,i'm going to put a prince in your belly,1,8,9
152,yara,euron can't defend the iron islands not if he's in king's landing with all his men and his ships,1,8,19
153,yara,we can take our home back,1,8,6
154,theon,daenerys went north,1,8,3
155,yara,daenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can't hold the north somewhere the dead can't go,1,8,17
156,theon,you're my queen i go where you command,1,8,8
157,yara,you want to go to winterfell to fight for the starks go what is dead may never die,1,8,18
158,theon,what is dead may never die,1,8,6
159,yara,but kill the bastards anyway,1,8,5
160,wolkan,welcome back my lady if you'd follow me,1,8,8
161,varys,the karstarks,1,8,2
162,tyrion,one of the better sigils beats an onion anyway,1,8,9
163,davos,can't argue with that,1,8,4
164,davos,not so long ago the starks and the karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield jon snow brought peace to the houses,1,8,23
165,tyrion,and our queen is grateful,1,8,5
166,davos,her gratitude is lovely but that's not my point the northmen are loyal to jon snow not to her they don't know her the free folk don't know her i've been up here a while and i'm telling you they're stubborn as goats you want their loyalty you have to earn it,1,8,52
167,tyrion,i sense that you're leading to a proposal,1,8,8
168,davos,a proposal is what i'm proposing on the off chance that we survive the night king what if the seven kingdoms for once in their whole shit history were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man,1,8,38
169,tyrion,they do make a handsome couple,1,8,6
170,varys,you overestimate our influence jon and daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men,1,8,15
171,tyrion,i'm not that old,1,8,4
172,tyrion,not as old as him,1,8,5
173,tyrion,our queen respects the wisdom of age,1,8,7
174,varys,of course she does respect is how the young keep us at a distance so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth,1,8,23
175,tyrion,what is that,1,8,3
176,varys,nothing lasts,1,8,2
177,daenerys,your sister doesn't like me,1,8,5
178,jon,she doesn't know you if it makes you feel any better she didn't like me either when we were growing up,1,8,21
179,daenerys,she doesn't need to be my friend but i am her queen if she can't respect me-,1,8,17
180,daenerys,how many today,1,8,3
181,dothraki man,only eighteen goats and eleven sheep,1,8,6
182,jon,what's the matter,1,8,3
183,daenerys,the dragons are barely eating,1,8,5
184,jon,what's wrong with them,1,8,4
185,daenerys,they don't like the north,1,8,5
186,daenerys,go on,1,8,2
187,jon,i don't know how to ride a dragon,1,8,8
188,daenerys,nobody does until they ride a dragon,1,8,7
189,jon,what if he doesn't want me to,1,8,7
190,daenerys,then i've enjoyed your company jon snow,1,8,7
191,jon,what do i hold onto,1,8,5
192,daenerys,whatever you can,1,8,3
193,jon,you've completely ruined horses for me,1,8,6
194,daenerys,we could stay a thousand years-,1,8,6
195,daenerys,no one would find us,1,8,5
196,jon,we'd be pretty old,1,8,4
197,jon,it's cold up here for a southern girl,1,8,8
198,daenerys,so keep your queen warm,1,8,5
199,daenerys,don't be afraid,1,8,3
200,man,gendry,1,8,1
201,man,he's here,1,8,2
202,gendry,it isn't easy making a blade that big with dragonglass,1,8,10
203,sandor,you're saying you're good is that it,1,8,7
204,gendry,i'm just saying it's a tricky material to-,1,8,8
205,sandor,you know who makes weapons for the wildlings cripples and cocksuckers which one are you,1,8,15
206,arya,leave him be,1,8,3
207,sandor,i heard you were here you left me to die,1,8,10
208,arya,first i robbed you,1,8,4
209,sandor,you're a cold little bitch aren't you guess that's why you're still alive,1,8,13
210,arya,that was a nice ax you made for him you've gotten better,1,8,12
211,gendry,yeah thanks so have you,1,8,5
212,gendry,i mean you look good,1,8,5
213,arya,thanks so do you,1,8,4

215,arya,stay close to that forge then,1,8,6
216,gendry,is that a command lady stark,1,8,6
217,arya,don't call me that,1,8,4
218,gendry,as you wish milady,1,8,4
219,arya,here's my wish,1,8,3
220,arya,can you make it,1,8,4
221,gendry,what do you need something like this for,1,8,8
222,arya,can you make it or not,1,8,6
223,gendry,you already have a sword what's that,1,8,7
224,gendry,it's valyrian steel i always knew you were just another rich girl,1,8,12
225,arya,you don't know any other rich girls,1,8,7
226,sansa,come in,1,8,2
227,sansa,lord glover wishes us good fortune but he's staying in deepwood motte with his men,1,8,15
228,jon,"house glover will stand behind house stark as we have for a thousand years"" isn't that what he said",1,8,19
229,sansa,"i will stand behind jon snow"" he said",1,8,8
230,sansa,the king in the north,1,8,5
231,jon,i told you we needed allies,1,8,6
232,sansa,you didn't tell me you were going to abandon your crown,1,8,11
233,jon,i never wanted a crown all i wanted was to protect the north i brought two armies home with me two dragons,1,8,22
234,sansa,and a targaryen queen,1,8,4
235,jon,do you think we can beat the army of the dead without her i fought them sansa twice you want to worry about who holds what title i'm telling you it doesn't matter without her we don't stand a chance,1,8,40
236,jon,do you have any faith in me at all,1,8,9
237,sansa,you know i do,1,8,4
238,jon,she'll be a good queen for all of us she's not her father,1,8,13
239,sansa,no she's much prettier,1,8,4
240,sansa,did you bend the knee to save the north or because you love her,1,8,14
241,sam,oh,1,8,1
242,daenerys,so you're the man,1,8,4
243,sam,um which man am i your grace,1,8,7
244,daenerys,the one who saved ser jorah when no one else could,1,8,11
245,jorah,they could they just wouldn't,1,8,5
246,daenerys,i'll have to make some changes in the citadel when i take my throne a great service merits a great reward,1,8,21
247,sam,oh it's my honor to serve you your grace,1,8,9
248,daenerys,well there must be something i could give you,1,8,9
249,sam,if it's not too much trouble i could use a pardon,1,8,11
250,daenerys,for what crime,1,8,3
251,sam,um i borrowed a few books from the citadel,1,8,9
252,sam,and also a sword,1,8,4
253,daenerys,from the citadel,1,8,3
254,sam,from my family it's been in house tarly for generations,1,8,10

273,sam,she's good,1,8,2
274,jon,little sam,1,8,2
275,sam,don't you know,1,8,3
276,jon,know what,1,8,2
277,sam,daenerys she executed my father and brother they were her prisoners,1,8,11
278,sam,she didn't tell you,1,8,4
279,jon,i'm so sorry we need to end this war,1,8,9
280,sam,would you have done it,1,8,5
281,jon,well i've executed men who disobeyed me,1,8,7
282,sam,you've also spared men thousands of wildlings when they refused to kneel,1,8,12
283,jon,i wasn't a king,1,8,4
284,sam,but you were you've always been,1,8,6
285,jon,i gave up my crown sam,1,8,6
286,jon,i bent the knee i'm not king in the north anymore,1,8,11
287,sam,i'm not talking about the king in the north i'm talking about the king of the bloody seven kingdoms,1,8,19
288,sam,bran and i worked it out i had a high septon's diary bran had whatever bran has,1,8,17
289,jon,what are you talking about,1,8,5
290,sam,your mother was lyanna stark,1,8,5
291,sam,and your father- your real father was rhaegar targaryen you've never been a bastard you're aegon targaryen true heir to the iron throne i'm sorry i know it's a lot to take in,1,8,33
292,jon,my father was the most honorable man i ever met you're saying he lied to me all my life,1,8,19
293,sam,no your father- well ned stark he promised your mother he'd always protect you and he did robert would have murdered you if he knew you're the true king aegon targaryen sixth of his name protector of the realm all of it,1,8,42
294,jon,daenerys is our queen,1,8,4
295,sam,she shouldn't be,1,8,3
296,jon,that's treason,1,8,2
297,sam,it's the truth you gave up your crown to save your people would she do the same,1,8,17
298,edd,stay back he's got blue eyes,1,8,6
299,tormund,i've always had blue eyes,1,8,5
300,beric,did you find anyone,1,8,4
301,edd,the umber boy,1,8,3
302,beric,it's a message from the night king,1,8,7
303,tormund,his army's between us and winterfell we're on foot,1,8,9
304,edd,we rode down from castle black we can double up on the horses,1,8,13
305,tormund,if the horses last we'll get there before the dead,1,8,10
306,tormund,we just have to hope the night king doesn't come first-,1,8,11
307,daenerys,when i was a child my brother would tell me a bedtime story about the man who murdered our father,2,8,20
308,daenerys,who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat who sat down on the iron throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor,2,8,26
309,daenerys,he told me other stories as well about all the things we would do to that man once we took back the seven kingdoms and had him in our grasp,2,8,30
310,daenerys,your sister pledged to send her army north,2,8,8
311,jaime,she did,2,8,2
312,daenerys,i don't see an army i see one man with one hand it appears your sister lied to me,2,8,19
313,jaime,she lied to me as well she never had any intention of sending her army north,2,8,16
314,jaime,she has euron greyjoy's fleet and 20000 fresh troops the golden company from essos bought and paid for even if we defeat the dead she'll have more than enough to destroy the survivors,2,8,33
315,daenerys,"we""",2,8,1
316,jaime,i promised to fight for the living i intend to keep that promise,2,8,13
317,tyrion,your grace i know my brother-,2,8,6
318,daenerys,like you knew your sister,2,8,5
319,tyrion,he came here alone knowing full well how he'd be received why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth,2,8,22
320,daenerys,perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him right up to the moment he slits my throat,2,8,18
321,sansa,you're right we can't trust him he attacked my father in the streets he tried to destroy my house and my family the same as he did yours,2,8,28
322,jaime,do you want me to apologize i won't we were at war everything i did i did for my house and my family i'd do it all again,2,8,28
323,bran,the things we do for love,2,8,6
324,daenerys,so why have you abandoned your house and family now,2,8,10
325,jaime,because this goes beyond loyalty,2,8,5
326,jaime,this is about survival,2,8,4
327,brienne,you don't know me well your grace,2,8,7
328,brienne,but i know ser jaime he is a man of honor i was his captor once but when we were both taken prisoner and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me ser jaime defended me and lost his hand because of it,2,8,45
329,brienne,without him my lady you would not be alive he armed me armored me and sent me to find you and bring you home because he'd sworn an oath to your mother,2,8,32
330,sansa,you vouch for him,2,8,4
331,brienne,i do,2,8,2
332,sansa,you would fight beside him,2,8,5
333,brienne,i would,2,8,2
334,sansa,i trust you with my life if you trust him with yours we should let him stay,2,8,17
335,daenerys,what does the warden of the north say about it,2,8,10
336,jon,we need every man we can get,2,8,7
337,daenerys,very well,2,8,2
338,jaime,thank you your grace,2,8,4
339,daenerys,either you knew cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise or you didn't know at all which makes you either a traitor or a fool,2,8,26
340,tyrion,i was a fool,2,8,4
341,daenerys,not for the first time,2,8,5
342,daenerys,cersei still sits on the throne if you can't help me take it back i'll find another hand who can,2,8,20
343,tyrion,i suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over,2,8,13
344,gendry,don't you have something better to do,2,8,7
345,arya,you make my weapon yet,2,8,5
346,gendry,just as soon as i'm done making a few thousand of these,2,8,12
347,arya,you should make mine first and make sure it's stronger than this,2,8,12
348,gendry,it's strong enough,2,8,3
349,gendry,it's going to be safer down in the crypt you know,2,8,11
350,arya,are you going to be down in the crypt,2,8,9
351,gendry,no but-,2,8,2
352,arya,but you're a fighter,2,8,4
353,gendry,i've done my share,2,8,4
354,arya,you've fought them,2,8,3
355,gendry,i did some of them,2,8,5
356,arya,how many,2,8,2
357,gendry,a few that was enough,2,8,5
358,arya,what are they like,2,8,4
359,gendry,bad really bad,2,8,3
360,arya,"really bad""",2,8,2
361,arya,"even a smith's apprentice can do better than ""really bad"" what do they look like what do they smell like how do they move how hard are they to kill",2,8,30
362,gendry,look i know you want to fight and i know you're not scared of rapers or murderers or-this is different this is-this is death you want to know what they're like death that's what they're like,2,8,36
363,arya,i know death,2,8,3
364,arya,he's got many faces,2,8,4
365,arya,i look forward to seeing this one,2,8,7
366,arya,my weapon,2,8,2
367,gendry,i'll get right on it,2,8,5
368,jaime,i'm sorry for what i did to you,2,8,8
369,bran,you weren't sorry then you were protecting your family,2,8,9
370,jaime,i'm not that person anymore,2,8,5
371,bran,you still would be if you hadn't pushed me out of that window and i would still be brandon stark,2,8,20
372,jaime,you're not,2,8,2
373,bran,no i'm something else now,2,8,5
374,jaime,you're not angry at me,2,8,5
375,bran,i'm not angry at anyone,2,8,5
376,jaime,why didn't you tell them,2,8,5
377,bran,you won't be able to help us in this fight if i let them murder you first,2,8,17
378,jaime,what about afterwards,2,8,3
379,bran,how do you know there is an afterwards,2,8,8
380,tyrion,well here we are,2,8,4
381,jaime,yes here we are,2,8,4
382,tyrion,together again,2,8,2
383,tyrion,and the masses rejoice,2,8,4
384,jaime,how do they feel about their new queen,2,8,8
385,tyrion,she's your new queen too,2,8,5
386,tyrion,they remember what happened the last time targaryens brought dragons north they'll come around once they see daenerys is different,2,8,20
387,jaime,and she is different,2,8,4
388,tyrion,she is,2,8,2
389,jaime,you're sure about her,2,8,4
390,tyrion,i am,2,8,2
391,jaime,she didn't seem sure about you,2,8,6
392,tyrion,it's hard to blame her i made a mistake common to clever people i underestimated my opponents,2,8,17
393,jaime,hmm,2,8,1
394,tyrion,cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her a chance for you both to start again and i believed her,2,8,20
395,tyrion,was she lying about the baby too,2,8,7
396,jaime,no that part is real,2,8,5
397,jaime,she's always been good at using the truth to tell lies i wouldn't be too hard on yourself she's fooled me more than anybody,2,8,24
398,jaime,what,2,8,1
399,tyrion,she never fooled you you always knew exactly what she was and you loved her anyway,2,8,16
400,tyrion,so we're going to die at winterfell not the death i wouldo ve chosen i always pictured myself dying in my own bed the age of 80 with a belly full of wine and-,2,8,34
401,both,a girl's mouth around-,2,8,4
402,jaime,your cock,2,8,2
403,tyrion,my cock,2,8,2
404,tyrion,at least cersei won't get to murder me i'm sure i'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while i'm being ripped apart by dead men,2,8,26
405,tyrion,maybe after i'm dead i'll march down to king's landing and rip her apart,2,8,14
406,brienne,ser jaime,2,8,2
407,jaime,lady brienne,2,8,2
408,jaime,he's come a long way,2,8,5
409,brienne,he's alright still has a lot to learn,2,8,8
410,jaime,i'm sure you'll teach him i've been told you're commanding the left flank,2,8,13
411,brienne,i am it's uh-it's good ground,2,8,6
412,jaime,it is,2,8,2
413,brienne,the rise it should give us some advantage,2,8,8
414,brienne,if we can keep a tight formation we might be able to beat them back,2,8,15
415,jaime,yes i think you're right,2,8,5
416,brienne,what are you doing,2,8,4
417,brienne,i think you know,2,8,4
418,jaime,i truly don't,2,8,3
419,brienne,we have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me not once,2,8,15
420,jaime,you want me to insult you,2,8,6
421,brienne,no,2,8,1
422,jaime,good,2,8,1
423,jaime,i came to winterfell because-i'm not the fighter i used to be but i'd be honored to serve under your command if you'll have me,2,8,25
424,brienne,i better get back,2,8,4
425,jorah,forgive me khaleesi,2,8,3
426,daenerys,have you done something to offend me,2,8,7
427,jorah,many things,2,8,2
428,daenerys,long ago and long forgiven,2,8,5
429,jorah,but you did forgive despite my failures when i heard you'd named tyrion your hand it broke my heart,2,8,19
430,daenerys,when i named him hand i didn't know if i'd ever see you again,2,8,14
431,jorah,you made the right choice,2,8,5
432,daenerys,i wasn't under the impression you liked him very much,2,8,10
433,jorah,i didn't his mouth hardly stopped moving between volantis and meereen it was all i could do not to throw him in the sea,2,8,24
434,jorah,but the mind behind all those words-,2,8,7
435,daenerys,he's made mistakes serious mistakes,2,8,5
436,jorah,as have we all he owns his and learns from them,2,8,11
437,daenerys,you're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position,2,8,11
438,jorah,i am and one other suggestion if you'll allow me,2,8,10
439,royce,the moment we can get the last infantryman out onto the field we should shut the gates,2,8,17
440,sansa,keep them open for as long as you can there are still people coming in from the countryside,2,8,18
441,daenerys,lady sansa i was hoping we could speak alone,2,8,9
442,daenerys,i thought you and i were on the verge of agreement before about ser jaime,2,8,15
443,sansa,brienne has been loyal to me always i trust her more than anyone,2,8,13
444,daenerys,i wish i could have that kind of faith in my advisors,2,8,12
445,sansa,tyrion is a good man he was never anything but decent towards me,2,8,13
446,daenerys,i didn't ask him to be my hand simply because he was good,2,8,13
447,daenerys,i asked him to be my hand because he was good and intelligent and ruthless when he had to be he never should have trusted cersei,2,8,26
448,sansa,you never should have either,2,8,5
449,daenerys,i thought he knew his sister,2,8,6
450,sansa,families are complicated,2,8,3
451,daenerys,ours certainly have been,2,8,4
452,sansa,a sad thing to have in common,2,8,7
453,daenerys,we have other things in common we've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule and we've both done a damn good job of it from what i can tell,2,8,38
454,daenerys,and yet i can't help but feel we're at odds with one another why is that your brother,2,8,18
455,sansa,he loves you you know that,2,8,6
456,daenerys,that bothers you,2,8,3
457,sansa,men do stupid things for women they're easily manipulated,2,8,9
458,daenerys,all my life i've known one goal,2,8,7
459,sansa,i should have thanked you the moment you arrived that was a mistake,2,8,13
460,daenerys,i'm here because i love your brother and i trust him and i know he's true to his word he's only the second man in my life i can say that about,2,8,32
461,sansa,who was the first,2,8,4
462,daenerys,someone taller,2,8,2
463,sansa,and what happens afterwards we defeat the dead we destroy cersei what happens then,2,8,14
464,daenerys,i take the iron throne,2,8,5
465,sansa,what about the north it was taken from us and we took it back and we said we'd never bow to anyone else again what about the north,2,8,28
466,wolkan,apologies my lady your grace,2,8,5
467,daenerys,what is it,2,8,3
468,theon,my queen,2,8,2
469,daenerys,your sister,2,8,2
470,theon,she only has a few ships and she couldn't sail them here so she's sailing to the iron islands instead to take them back in your name,2,8,27
471,daenerys,but why aren't you with her,2,8,6
472,theon,i want to fight for winterfell lady sansa if you'll have me,2,8,12
473,man,milord we're not soldiers,2,8,4
474,davos,you are now look i made it through most of my years without ever getting near a fight but then i survived the battle of the bastards right outside these walls if i can live through that you can live through this they'll outfit you with weapons at the forge right that way,2,8,53
475,man,thank you,2,8,2
476,gilly,when the time comes you'll be down in the crypts,2,8,10
477,gilly,they're the safest place to be through that archway right over there,2,8,12
478,woman,thank you,2,8,2
479,teela,which way should i go,2,8,5
480,davos,which way do you want to go,2,8,7
481,teela,all the children will be going below when the time comes,2,8,11
482,teela,but both me brothers were soldiers i want to fight too,2,8,11
483,gilly,that's good to hear i'm going to be in the crypt with my son and i'd feel a lot better with you down there to protect us,2,8,27
484,davos,i'm sure a lot of people would,2,8,7
485,teela,all right i'll defend the crypt then,2,8,7
486,tormund,my little crow,2,8,3
487,jon,i thought we'd lost you,2,8,5
488,tormund,almost,2,8,1
489,jon,how did you find each other,2,8,6
490,edd,we met up at the last hearth,2,8,7
491,tormund,the dead got there first,2,8,5
492,jon,the umbers,2,8,2
493,beric,fighting for the night king now,2,8,6
494,tormund,we had to travel around them to get here whoever's not here now is with them,2,8,16
495,jon,how long do we have,2,8,5
496,tormund,before the sun comes up tomorrow,2,8,6
497,tormund,the big woman still here,2,8,5
498,jon,they're coming,2,8,2
499,jon,we have dragonglass and valyrian steel,2,8,6
500,jon,but there are too many of them,2,8,7
501,jon,far too many,2,8,3
502,jon,our enemy doesn't tire,2,8,4
503,jon,doesn't stop doesn't feel,2,8,4
504,jon,we can't beat them in a straight fight,2,8,8
505,jaime,so what can we do,2,8,5
506,jon,the night king made them all they follow his command if he falls getting to him may be our best chance,2,8,21
507,jaime,if that's true he'll never expose himself,2,8,7
508,bran,yes he will,2,8,3
509,bran,he'll come for me he's tried before many times with many three-eyed ravens,2,8,13
510,sam,why what does he want,2,8,5
511,bran,an endless night he wants to erase this world and i am its memory,2,8,14
512,sam,that's what death is isn't it forgetting being forgotten if we forget where we've been and what we've done we're not men anymore just animals your memories don't come from books your stories aren't just stories if i wanted to erase the world of men i'd start with you,2,8,49
513,tyrion,how will he find you,2,8,5
514,bran,his mark is on me,2,8,5
515,bran,he always knows where i am,2,8,6
516,jon,we'll put you in the crypt where it's safest,2,8,9
517,bran,no we need to lure him into the open before his army destroys us all i'll wait for him in the godswood,2,8,22
518,sansa,you want us to use you as bait,2,8,8
519,arya,we're not leaving you alone out there,2,8,7
520,theon,he won't be i'll stay with him with the ironborn i took this castle from you let me defend you now,2,8,21
521,davos,we'll hold off the rest of them for as long as we can,2,8,13
522,tyrion,when the time comes ser davos and i will be on the walls to give you the signal to light the trench,2,8,22
523,daenerys,ser davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own you'll be in the crypt,2,8,17
524,tyrion,your grace i have fought before i can do it again alongside the men and women risking their lives,2,8,19
525,daenerys,there are thousands of them and only one of you you can't fight as well as they can but you can think better than any of them you're here because of your mind if we survive i'll need it,2,8,39
526,davos,the dragons should give us an edge in the field,2,8,10
527,jon,if they're in the field they're not protecting bran we need to be near him not too near or the night king won't come but close enough to pursue him when he does,2,8,33
528,arya,dragonfire will stop him,2,8,4
529,bran,i don't know no one's ever tried,2,8,7
530,tormund,we're all going to die,2,8,5
531,tormund,but at least we die together,2,8,6
532,jon,let's get some rest,2,8,4
533,jon,your grace,2,8,2
534,tyrion,do you need help,2,8,4
535,bran,no,2,8,1
536,tyrion,you've had a strange journey,2,8,5
537,bran,stranger than most,2,8,3
538,tyrion,i'd like to hear about it,2,8,6
539,bran,it's a long story,2,8,4
540,tyrion,if only we were trapped in a castle in the middle of winter with nowhere to go,2,8,17
541,missandei,hello,2,8,1
542,grey worm,when daenerys takes her throne there will be no place for us here i am loyal to my queen i will fight for her until her enemies are defeated but when the war is over and she has won do you want to grow old in this place is there nothing else you want to do nothing else you want to see,2,8,62
543,missandei,naath i'd like to see the beaches again,2,8,8
544,grey worm,then i will take you there,2,8,6

555,sam,everyone seems to forget that i was the first man to kill a white walker i've killed thenns,2,8,18
556,edd,thenn,2,8,1
557,sam,i've saved gilly more than once i stole a considerable number of books from the citadel library survived the fist of the first men you need me out there,2,8,29
558,edd,well if that's what it's come to we really are fucked,2,8,11
559,sam,"well calling you ""fucked"" wouldn't be strictly accurate",2,8,8
560,edd,samwell tarly slayer of white walkers lover of ladies as if we needed any more signs the world was ending,2,8,20

565,tyrion,i would love to see the look on his face when he realizes his two sons are about to die defending winterfell,2,8,22
566,jaime,that would be something to see,2,8,6
567,tyrion,i remember the first time we were here the first time i saw this hall,2,8,15
568,jaime,mm,2,8,1
569,tyrion,you were a golden lion i was a drunken whore-monger it was all so simple,2,8,15
570,jaime,it wasn't so simple i was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister,2,8,24
571,tyrion,i was speaking in relative terms,2,8,6
572,jaime,do you miss it,2,8,4
573,tyrion,of course i miss it,2,8,5
574,jaime,well my golden lion days are done but whore-mongering is still an option for you,2,8,15
575,tyrion,it's not things would be easier if it were,2,8,9
576,tyrion,the perils of self-betterment,2,8,4
577,jaime,oh my lady,2,8,3

580,podrick,thank you milord,2,8,3

950,daenerys,jon snow,5,8,2
951,tyrion,varys,5,8,1
952,daenerys,he knows the truth about jon,5,8,6
953,tyrion,he does,5,8,2
954,daenerys,because you told him you learned from sansa and she learned from jon though i begged him not to tell her as i said he betrayed me,5,8,27
955,tyrion,i'm glad sansa told me i am your hand i need to be aware of any threats you're facing,5,8,19
956,daenerys,and varys,5,8,2
957,tyrion,your master of whisperers needs to be aware too,5,8,9
958,daenerys,you spoke to him first without coming to me without asking my permission,5,8,13
959,tyrion,it was a mistake,5,8,4
960,daenerys,why do you think sansa told you what do you think she hoped to gain,5,8,15
961,tyrion,she trusts me,5,8,3
962,daenerys,yes she trusts you she trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen and you did not let her down,5,8,23
963,tyrion,if i have failed you my queen forgive me our intentions were good we wanted what you want a better world all of us varys as much as anyone,5,8,29
964,tyrion,but it doesn't matter now,5,8,5
965,daenerys,no it doesn't matter now,5,8,5
966,tyrion,it was me,5,8,3
967,varys,i hope i deserve this truly i do i hope i'm wrong goodbye old friend,5,8,15
968,daenerys,lord varys i daenerys of house targaryen first of my name breaker of chains and mother of dragons ,5,8,18
969,daenerys,sentence you to die dracarys,5,8,5
970,daenerys,this was all she brought with her when we crossed the narrow sea her only possession,5,8,16
971,daenerys,it's all right torgo nudo let me speak with him,5,8,10
972,daenerys,what did i say would happen if you told your sister,5,8,11
973,jon,i don't want it and that's what i told him,5,8,10
974,daenerys,she betrayed your trust she killed varys as much as i did this was a victory for her now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you far more people in westeros love you than love me i don't have love here i only have fear,5,8,49
975,jon,i love you and you will always be my queen,5,8,10
976,daenerys,is that all i am to you your queen,5,8,9
977,daenerys,all right then,5,8,3
978,daenerys,let it be fear,5,8,4
979,tyrion,the people who live there they're not your enemies they're innocents like the ones you liberated in meereen,5,8,18
980,daenerys,in meereen the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment i arrived,5,8,17
981,tyrion,they're afraid anyone who resists cersei will see his family butchered you can't expect them to be heroes they're hostages,5,8,20
982,daenerys,they are in a tyrant's grip whose fault is that mine,5,8,11
983,tyrion,what does it matter whose fault it is thousands of children will die if the city burns,5,8,17
984,daenerys,your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them that's what she thinks our mercy is - weakness,5,8,20
985,tyrion,i beg you my queen-,5,8,5
986,daenerys,but she's wrong mercy is our strength our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant,5,8,22
987,daenerys,ready the unsullied tonight you sail for king's landing to join the northern armies,5,8,14
988,tyrion,cersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost give them that chance if the city surrenders they will ring the bells and raise the gates please if you hear them ringing the bells call off the attack,5,8,41
989,daenerys,wait for me outside the city you'll know when it's time,5,8,11
990,daenerys,your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines,5,8,10
991,daenerys,it seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all the next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me,5,8,23
992,guard,let them pass,5,8,3
993,guard,through the gate,5,8,3
994,guard,get going,5,8,2
995,davos,the rearguard should be here by daybreak,5,8,7

999,soldier,my lord,5,8,2

1002,soldier,he's always better when he's got some food in him,5,8,10
1003,soldier,problem is when he's got drink in him see what he did the other week,5,8,15

1008,soldier,i need to go talk to my captain,5,8,8
1009,sandor clegane,go ahead talk to him,5,8,5
1010,soldier,where's he going,5,8,3

1013,tyrion,i want to see the ,5,8,5
1014,unsullied,we speak the common tongue,5,8,5
1015,tyrion,ah good i want to be alone with the prisoner get some rest tomorrow will be a long day,5,8,19
1016,unsullied,we have orders to guard the prisoner,5,8,7
1017,tyrion,ordered by whom the queen herself,5,8,6
1018,unsullied,no,5,8,1
1019,tyrion,well in that case as hand of the queen i outrank whomever gave your order probably by quite a lot,5,8,20
1020,tyrion,how did they find you,5,8,5
1021,tyrion,did you consider taking it off,5,8,6
1022,jaime,"cersei once called me ""the stupidest lannister""",5,8,7
1023,tyrion,and you're going back to her to die with her,5,8,10
1024,jaime,you've underestimated her before,5,8,4
1025,tyrion,she's going to die unless you can convince her to change her course of action,5,8,15
1026,jaime,difficult to do from here,5,8,5
1027,jaime,when have i ever been able to convince cersei of anything,5,8,11
1028,tyrion,try if not for yourself if not for her then for every one of the million people in that city innocent or otherwise,5,8,23
1029,jaime,to be honest i never really cared much for them innocent or otherwise,5,8,13
1030,tyrion,you do care for one innocent i know you do and so does cersei she has a reason now,5,8,19
1031,jaime,the child is the reason she'll never give an inch all the worst things she's ever done she's done for her children it's not impossible that she'll win,5,8,28
1032,tyrion,she won't her enemy's forces have been depleted as she said they would be,5,8,14
1033,jaime,two of the three dragons are dead she's evened the odds,5,8,11
1034,tyrion,the city will fall tomorrow,5,8,5
1035,jaime,she has the lannister army she has the golden company-,5,8,10
1036,tyrion,i defended the city last time it was attacked i know it better than anyone it will fall tomorrow,5,8,19
1037,jaime,then i suppose i'll die tomorrow if not before,5,8,9
1038,tyrion,why,5,8,1
1039,tyrion,escape the two of you together remember where we met where they keep the dragon skulls beneath the red keep take her down there keep following the stairways down down as far as they'll go you'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep a dinghy will be waiting for you sail out of the bay if the winds are kind you'll make it to pentos start a new life,5,8,73
1040,jaime,sail right past the iron fleet and into a new life sounds a lot less likely than cersei winning this war-,5,8,21
1041,tyrion,there won't be an iron fleet for much longer do it if you don't you'll never see cersei again,5,8,19
1042,tyrion,swear to me,5,8,3
1043,jaime,you have my word,5,8,4
1044,tyrion,if it works give the order to ring all the bells in king's landing and open the gates that will be our signal that the city has surrendered,5,8,28
1045,jaime,i'll try,5,8,2
1046,tyrion,i never thought i'd get to repay the favor remember ring the bells and open the gates,5,8,17
1047,jaime,your queen will execute you for this,5,8,7
1048,tyrion,if daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible,5,8,26
1049,tyrion,tens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems like a fair trade if it weren't for you i never wouldo ve survived my childhood,5,8,29
1050,jaime,you would have,5,8,3
1051,tyrion,you were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster you were all i had,5,8,17

1265,tyrion,i should be thankful oblivion is the best i could hope for i strangled my lover i shot my own father with a crossbow i betrayed my queen,6,8,28
1266,jon,you didn't,6,8,2
1267,tyrion,i did and i'd do it again now that i've seen what i've seen i chose my fate the people of king's landing did not,6,8,25
1268,jon,i can't justify what happened i won't try but the war is over now,6,8,14
1269,tyrion,is it when you heard her talking to her soldiers did she sound like someone who's done fighting,6,8,18
1270,tyrion,she liberated the people of slaver's bay she liberated the people of king's landing and she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all,6,8,32
1271,jon,and you've been by her side counseling her until today,6,8,10
1272,tyrion,until today varys was right i was wrong it was vanity to think i could guide her our queen's nature is fire and blood,6,8,24
1273,jon,you think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are then i'd be fire and blood too she's not her father no more than you're tywin lannister,6,8,35
1274,tyrion,my father was an evil man my sister was an evil woman pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day,6,8,40
1275,jon,cersei left her no choice,6,8,5
1276,tyrion,the moment the gates fell the battle was over,6,8,9
1277,jon,she saw her friend beheaded she saw her dragon shot out of the sky,6,8,14
1278,tyrion,and she burned down a city for it,6,8,8
1279,jon,ah it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield,6,8,12
1280,tyrion,would you have done it,6,8,5
1281,jon,what,6,8,1
1282,tyrion,you've been up there on a dragon's back you've had that power would you have burned the city down,6,8,19
1283,jon,i don't know,6,8,3
1284,tyrion,yes you do you won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know,6,8,16
1285,jon,what's it matter what i'd do,6,8,6
1286,tyrion,it matters more than anything when she murdered the slavers of astapor i'm sure no one but the slavers complained after all they were evil men,6,8,26
1287,tyrion,when she crucified hundreds of meereenese nobles who could argue they were evil men the dothraki khals she burned alive they would have done worse to her everywhere she goes evil men die and we cheer her for it and she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right she believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone if you believed that if you truly believed it wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise,6,8,83
1288,tyrion,i know you love her i love her too not as successfully as you but i believed in her with all my heart love is more powerful than reason we all know that look at my brother,6,8,37
1289,jon,love is the death of duty,6,8,6
1290,tyrion,you just came up with that,6,8,6
1291,jon,maester aemon said it a long time ago,6,8,8
1292,tyrion,sometimes duty is the death of love you are the shield that guards the realms of men and you've always tried to do the right thing no matter the cost you've tried to protect people who is the greatest threat to the people now,6,8,44
1293,tyrion,it's a terrible thing i'm asking it's also the right thing do you think i'm the last man she'll execute who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the iron throne,6,8,32
1294,jon,that's her decision she is the queen,6,8,7
1295,jon,i'm sorry it came to this,6,8,6
1296,tyrion,and your sisters do you see them bending the knee,6,8,10
1297,jon,my sisters will be loyal to the throne,6,8,8
1298,tyrion,why do you think sansa told me the truth about you because she doesn't want dany to be queen,6,8,19
1299,jon,she doesn't get to choose,6,8,5
1300,tyrion,no but you do and you have to choose now,6,8,10
1301,daenerys,when i was a girl my brother told me it was made with a thousand swords from aegon's fallen enemies what do a thousand swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to twenty i imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb so many fallen enemies you could only see the soles of aegon's feet,6,8,62
1302,jon,i saw them executing lannister prisoners in the street they said they were acting on your orders,6,8,17
1303,daenerys,it was necessary,6,8,3
1304,jon,necessary have you been down there have you seen children little children burned,6,8,13
1305,daenerys,i tried to make peace with cersei she used their innocence as a weapon against me she thought it would cripple me,6,8,22
1306,jon,and tyrion,6,8,2
1307,daenerys,he conspired behind my back with my enemies how have you treated people who've done the same to you even when it broke your heart,6,8,25
1308,jon,forgive him,6,8,2
1309,daenerys,i can't,6,8,2
1310,jon,you can you can forgive all of them make them see they made a mistake make them understand,6,8,18
1311,jon,please dany,6,8,2
1312,daenerys,we can't hide behind small mercies the world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have,6,8,21
1313,jon,the world we need is a world of mercy it has to be,6,8,13
1314,daenerys,and it will be it's not easy to see something that's never been before a good world,6,8,17
1315,jon,how do you know how do you know it'll be good,6,8,11
1316,daenerys,because i know what is good and so do you,6,8,10
1317,jon,i don't,6,8,2
1318,daenerys,you do you do you've always known,6,8,7
1319,jon,what about everyone else all the other people who think they know what's good,6,8,14
1320,daenerys,they don't get to choose,6,8,5
1321,daenerys,be with me build the new world with me this is our reason it has been from the beginning since you were a little boy with a bastardo s name and i was a little girl who couldn't count to twenty we do it together we break the wheel together,6,8,50
1322,jon,you are my queen now and always,6,8,7
1323,sansa,where's jon,6,8,2
1324,grey worm,he is our prisoner,6,8,4
1325,sansa,so is lord tyrion they were both to be brought to this gathering,6,8,13
1326,grey worm,we will decide what we do with our prisoners this is our city now,6,8,14
1327,sansa,if you look outside the walls of your city you'll find thousands of northmen who will explain to you why harming jon snow is not in your interest,6,8,28
1328,grey worm,and you will find thousands of unsullied who believe that it is,6,8,12
1329,yara,some of you may be quick to forgive the ironborn are not i swore to follow daenerys targaryen,6,8,18
1330,sansa,you swore to follow a tyrant,6,8,6
1331,yara,she freed us from a tyrant cersei is gone because of her and jon snow put a knife in her heart let the unsullied give him what he deserves,6,8,29
1332,arya,say another word about killing my brother and i'll cut your throat,6,8,12
1333,davos,friends please we've been cutting each other's throats long enough torgo nudho am i saying that properly,6,8,17
1334,davos,if it weren't for you and your men we wouldo ve lost the war with the dead this country owes you a debt it can never repay but let us try there is land in the reach good land the people that used to live there are gone make it your own start your own house with the unsullied as your bannermen we've had enough war thousands of you thousands of them you know how it ends we need to find a better way,6,8,84
1335,grey worm,we do not need payment we need justice jon snow cannot go free,6,8,13
1336,tyrion,it's not for you to decide,6,8,6
1337,grey worm,you are not here to speak everyone has heard enough words from you,6,8,13
1338,tyrion,you're right and no one's any better for it but it's not for you to decide jon committed his crime here his fate is for our king to decide or our queen,6,8,32
1339,wolkan,we don't have a king or queen,6,8,7
1340,tyrion,you're the most powerful people in westeros choose one,6,8,9
1341,grey worm,make your choice then,6,8,4
1342,edmure,my lords and ladies i suppose this is the most important moment of our lives what we decide today will reverberate through the annals of history i stand before you as one of the senior lords in the country a veteran of two wars and i like to think my experience has led to some small skill in statecraft - and underst-,6,8,62
1343,sansa,uncle please sit,6,8,3
1344,wolkan,well we have to choose someone,6,8,6
1345,sam,why just us,6,8,3
1346,sam,um- we represent all the great houses but whomever we choose they won't just rule over lords and ladies maybe the decision about what's best for everyone should be left to well everyone,6,8,33
1347,edmure,maybe we should give the dogs a vote as well,6,8,10
1348,yohn royce,i'll ask my horse,6,8,4
1349,edmure,i suppose you want the crown,6,8,6
1350,tyrion,me the imp,6,8,3
1351,tyrion,half the people hate me for serving daenerys the other half hate me for betraying her,6,8,16
1352,tyrion,can't think of a worse choice,6,8,6
1353,davos,who then,6,8,2
1354,tyrion,i've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks about our bloody history about the mistakes we've made,6,8,20
1355,tyrion,what unites people armies gold flags stories there's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story nothing can stop it no enemy can defeat it and who has a better story than bran the broken the boy who fell from a high tower and lived he knew he'd never walk again so he learned to fly he crossed beyond the wall a crippled boy and became the three-eyed raven he is our memory the keeper of all our stories the wars weddings births massacres famines our triumphs mm our defeats our past who better to lead us into the future,6,8,102
1356,sansa,bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children,6,8,11
1357,tyrion,good sons of kings can be cruel and stupid as you well know his will never torment us that is the wheel our queen wanted to break,6,8,27
1358,tyrion,from now on rulers will not be born they will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of westeros to serve the realm,6,8,26
1359,tyrion,i know you don't want it i know you don't care about power but i ask you now if we choose you will you wear the crown will you lead the seven kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day,6,8,46
1360,bran,why do you think i came all this way,6,8,9
1361,tyrion,to brandon of house stark i say aye,6,8,8
1362,sam,aye,6,8,1
1363,edmure,aye,6,8,1

1370,ironb,aye,6,8,1
1371,vale,aye,6,8,1
1372,gendry,aye,6,8,1
1373,davos,i'm not sure i get a vote but aye,6,8,9
1374,brienne,aye,6,8,1
1375,sansa,i love you little brother i always will you'll be a good king but tens of thousands of northmen fell in the great war defending all of westeros and those who survived have seen too much and fought too hard ever to kneel again the north will remain an independent kingdom as it was for thousands of years,6,8,58
1376,tyrion,all hail bran the broken first of his name king of the andals and the first men lord of the six kingdoms and protector of the realm,6,8,27
1377,all,all hail bran the broken,6,8,5
1378,bran,lord tyrion you will be my hand,6,8,7
1379,tyrion,n- no your grace i don't want it,6,8,8
1380,bran,and i don't want to be king,6,8,7
1381,tyrion,i don't deserve it i thought i was wise but i wasn't i thought i knew what was right but i didn't choose ser davos choose anyone else,6,8,28
1382,bran,i choose you,6,8,3
1383,grey worm,you cannot,6,8,2
1384,bran,yes i can i'm king,6,8,5
1385,grey worm,this man is a criminal he deserves justice,6,8,8
1386,bran,he just got it he's made many terrible mistakes he's going to spend the rest of his life fixing them,6,8,20
1387,grey worm,it is not enough,6,8,4
1388,tyrion,giving you to the unsullied would start a war letting you walk free would start a war so our new king has chosen to send you to the night's watch,6,8,30
1389,jon,there's still a night's watch,6,8,5
1390,tyrion,the world will always need a home for bastards and broken men,6,8,12
1391,tyrion,you shall take no wife hold no lands father no children the unsullied wanted your head of course but grey worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence sansa and arya wanted you freed but they understand our new king needs to make peace no one is very happy which means it's a good compromise i suppose,6,8,58
1392,jon,was it right what i did,6,8,6
1393,tyrion,what we did,6,8,3
1394,jon,it doesn't feel right,6,8,4
1395,tyrion,ask me again in ten years,6,8,6
1396,jon,i don't expect we'll ever see each other again,6,8,9
1397,tyrion,i wouldn't be so sure a few years as hand of the king would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world,6,8,25
1398,unsullied,all the men have boarded,6,8,5
1399,grey worm,good we sail for the isle of naath,6,8,8
1400,sansa,i wish there had been another way can you forgive me,6,8,11
1401,jon,the north is free thanks to you,6,8,7
1402,sansa,but they lost their king,6,8,5
1403,jon,ned stark's daughter will speak for them she's the best they could ask for,6,8,14
1404,jon,you can come see me you know at castle black,6,8,10
1405,arya,i can't,6,8,2
1406,jon,you think anyone will dare tell you women aren't allowed,6,8,10
1407,arya,i'm not going back north,6,8,5
1408,sansa,where are you going,6,8,4
1409,arya,what's west of westeros,6,8,4
1410,arya,no one knows it's where all the maps stop that's where i'm going,6,8,13
1411,jon,you have your needle,6,8,4
1412,arya,right here,6,8,2
1413,jon,your grace,6,8,2
1414,jon,i'm sorry i wasn't there when you needed me,6,8,9
1415,bran,you were exactly where you were supposed to be,6,8,9
1416,tyrion,that's not- uh-,6,8,3
1417,tyrion,what's this,6,8,2
1418,sam,a song of ice and fire archmaester ebrose's history of the wars following the death of king robert i helped him with the title,6,8,24
1419,tyrion,i suppose i come in for some heavy criticism,6,8,9
1420,sam,oh i wouldn't say that,6,8,5
1421,tyrion,oh he's kind to me never wouldo ve guessed,6,8,9
1422,tyrion,he's not kind,6,8,3
1423,sam,he-,6,8,1
1424,tyrion,he what what does he say about me,6,8,8
1425,sam,i don't believe you're mentioned ahem,6,8,6
1426,tyrion,your grace,6,8,2
1427,davos,your grace,6,8,2
1428,bronn,your grace,6,8,2
1429,sam,your grace,6,8,2
1430,bran,we appear to be missing a master of whisperers and a master of laws and a master of war,6,8,19
1431,tyrion,yes your grace suitable prospects will be brought to you for an audience in the coming weeks,6,8,17
1432,bran,and drogon any word,6,8,4
1433,sam,he was last spotted flying east toward-,6,8,7
1434,bronn,the farther away the better,6,8,5
1435,bran,perhaps i can find him do carry on with the rest,6,8,11
1436,tyrion,as you wish your grace,6,8,5
1437,brienne,ser podrick,6,8,2
1438,tyrion,we serve at your pleasure king bran the broken ruler of the six kingdoms and protector of the realm long may he reign,6,8,23
1439,sam,long may he reign,6,8,4
1440,davos,long may he reign,6,8,4
1441,brienne,long may he reign,6,8,4
1442,bronn,long may he reign,6,8,4
1443,tyrion,that will improve,6,8,3
1444,bran,i'm sure it will,6,8,4
1445,tyrion,ser bronn of the blackwater lord of highgarden lord paramount of the reach and master of coin would you say the crown's debt to you has been paid,6,8,28
1446,bronn,in full my lord hand,6,8,5
1447,tyrion,good time to start incurring a new one we have hungry people to feed can we expect some assistance in this regard,6,8,22
1448,bronn,indeed we can,6,8,3
1449,tyrion,lord davos we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair,6,8,12
1450,davos,we have these projects will begin as soon as the master of coin and lord of lofty titles provides funding,6,8,20
1451,bronn,the master of coin looks forward to helping the master of ships but first he has to ensure we're not wasting coin or soon there won't be no more coin,6,8,30
1452,davos,any more,6,8,2
1453,bronn,you master of grammar now too,6,8,6
1454,tyrion,grandmaester ahem it is my theory based on my years of work on the casterly rock sewers that clean water leads to a healthier population,6,8,25
1455,sam,the archmaester has done some research on this subject and it turns out-,6,8,13
1456,bronn,the strong live and the weak don't,6,8,7
1457,tyrion,find the best builders and set them to the task,6,8,10
1458,bronn,oh speaking of builders all the best brothels burned down the master of coin is willing to fund reconstruction,6,8,19
1459,sam,uh the archmaester is less than enthusiastic about the salutary effects of brothels,6,8,13
1460,bronn,well i imagine he isn't using them properly,6,8,8
1461,brienne,i think we can all agree that ships take precedence over brothels,6,8,12
1462,bronn,i think that's a very presumptuous statement,6,8,7
1463,tyrion,i once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel,6,8,11
1464,man,the queen in the north,6,8,5
1465,all,the queen in the north the queen in the north the queen in the north the queen in the north the queen in the north,6,8,25
